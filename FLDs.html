                            their practice of polygamy – when a man marries
                            multiple women at once.
                            <br><br>
                            With Television shows being aired, and books being launched about this religious group,
                            it’s time to get to know them a
                            little better.<br><br>

                            Here are 15 fascinating facts about the FLDS.<br><br>
                        </p>



                        <ol type="1" class="fs-4">
                            <li>The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or FLDS as they are
                                also known as, is a part of the
                                Latter Day Saint movement, started by Joseph Smith in 1830. Joseph Smith is known as
                                the first prophet of the more
                                well-known Mormon / LDS Church. All Latter Day Saint movements can trace their
                                history back to this man.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Are the FLDS Mormon? It’s been quite a heavily debated topic for some time now. A
                                common misconception is that the name
                                “Mormon” is only given to those of the LDS Church. This, however, is incorrect. The
                                name “Mormon” was a commonly used
                                nickname directed towards those who followed Brigham Young, one of a handful of
                                people who claimed to be next in the
                                line for Prophet after Joseph Smith’s after his death. This means that any Latter
                                Day Saint movement that can trace
                                their apostolic lineage back to Joseph Smith via Brigham Young are classed as being
                                Mormon.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The FLDS is the largest fundamentalist group of the Latter Day Saint movement. To be
                                classed as a fundamentalist group,
                                the group has to actively believe and practice one of the fundamental aspects of
                                Mormonism as taught by the first two
                                prophets, Brigham Young and Joseph Smith. The FLDS still believe and practice in a
                                number of these fundamental aspects
                                such as plural marriage, and something called the United Order, which is often
                                described as a form of Egalitarian
                                Communalism.<br><br></li>
                            <li>In recent years there have been many popular television series made about the FLDS,
                                including Breaking the Faith and
                                Escaping the Prophet.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Their current Prophet, Warren Jeffs, was placed on the FBI’s Top 10 Most Wanted list
                                after he fled from his charges
                                relating to child marriage. He is currently serving a life sentence plus 20 years in
                                prison for charges relating to
                                bigamy, and child marriage.

                                <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li>Due to the Church’s beliefs regarding plural marriage, and the requirements required
                                to enter the top Kingdom of Glory
                                in Heaven (Where God Himself lives), the Prophet Warren Jeffs has 84 wives.<br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li>Since the arrest of the Prophet in 2009, a new doctrine was formed. This new
                                practice states that the only men who are
                                able to father children are a group of 15 men, or “seed bearers” as they are known
                                as. A Seed Barer is a man who comes
                                from a worthy bloodline chosen by their leaders.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Due to their practice of plural marriage, a big problem for them has arisen in the
                                past couple of decades where the
                                ratio between FLDS men and women has remained the same. As the men must marry
                                multiple women to make it into heaven,
                                there are not enough women to fulfill this idea. This issue has led to a large
                                number of young boys and men being
                                abandoned for breaking rules. Once they have been removed from the Church and its
                                communities, they are no longer
                                allowed to maintain contact with any friends or family members within the
                                church.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Over the years, a number of members have left the Church and their communities
                                behind for freedom, and have shared their
                                stories. Some of these stories have made it into books such as Escape, Stolen
                                Innocence, Lost Boy & Under the Banner of
                                Heaven.<br><br></li>
                            <li>In 2015 the membership of the FLDS was estimated to be around 10,000, with between
                                500 & 1,000 members leaving between
                                2013 and 2015.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The majority of the FLDS membership live in one of a handful of ranches in America:
                                Short Creek in Arizona, Hildale
                                Utah, Colorado Utah, and Eldorado Texas. There’s also a large colony in Bountiful in
                                British Columbia, Canada.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Women within the church are often notifiable by their pastel-colored clothing that
                                fully covers their legs, arms, body,
                                and shoulders. The idea is to remove any personal traits and to mimic the FLDS’s
                                idea of what a perfect woman should be
                                like. The different pastel-colored dresses show which women are married to which
                                husband. The colors red and black are
                                forbidden to be worn amongst the members. The reasoning behind this is that when
                                Jesus returns, he will be the one to
                                wear red, and black is believed to be the color of Satan.<br><br></li>
                            <li>In 1984 after the death of the 3rd Prophet Leroy S. Johnson, a small group of FLDS
                                members broke away from their Church
                                and became known as the Centennial Park Group, who took up residence in Centennial
                                Park, Arizona. They call themselves
                                “The Work”, and broke away from the FLDS over their Doctrine of the “One Man Rule” –
                                That only one man on earth may hold
                                all of the Priesthood keys and power of God.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Due to the ratio of men to women as mentioned before, intermarriage is a common
                                practice among the FLDS members, often
                                marrying their first or second cousins. This has had a dramatic effect on many of
                                the member’s lives, and as such their
                                communities are ramped with a condition known as fumarase deficiency. These
                                conditions cause server mental issues, and
                                problems that affect the nervous system. Outside of the FLDS ranches, this condition
                                is very rare, having only 13 known
                                cases worldwide up to 1990. After 1990, 20 cases were discovered within one of the
                                FLDS communities based in Arizona.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The current and future leadership of the FLDS is currently unknown. The next in
                                succession to Warren Jeffs was a man
                                called Lyle Jeffs, who is Warren’s brother. However, it has been reported that in
                                2012, Warren removed Lyle from office
                                in 2012. The church has two leadership roles, the President, and the Prophet. The
                                President is not required to be the
                                Prophet, although traditionally this normally is the case. On December 4, 2010,
                                Warren Jeffs officially resigned as the
                                President of the FLDS church. His status as Prophet is currently unknown.<br><br>
