                            humans to exist.<br><br>

                            The bible tells of their tale from the creation of man on the sixth day to learning
                            about sin, but do we know what
                            happened to them after they were banished from the Garden of Eden?<br><br>

                            The bible is full of hidden clues to the mysterious couple’s lives.<br><br>

                            Here are 10 interesting facts about Adam and Eve that will leave you wanting to know
                            more about the lives of these
                            legendary characters.<br><br></p>

                                <li>Adam was named after the elements he was created from.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">So in the Bible, it explains that God created the first man,
                                who he called Adam, from mere dust.<br><br>

                                There is some debate as to the meaning of the word or name ‘Adam’, but most commonly
                                it means man or mankind.<br><br>

                                It is closely related to a word in Hebrew which means dust, and the bible explains
                                how God created the first man from
                                dust.<br><br>

                                The name chosen for man represents what he was; a human and also reflects the
                                elements he was created from; dust.<br><br></p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The name Eve means to give life.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">If you are familiar with the story of Adam and Eve then you
                                will know that Eve was made from taking one of Adam’s rib
                                bones.<br><br>

                                This is where the word woman comes from, as Eve was created from Adam, a
                                man.<br><br>

                                She was given the name Eve, which is closely related to the name Eva in Latin which
                                originated from the Hebrew name
                                ‘Chavah’, which means living or to give life.<br><br></p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Adam lived to 930 years old!
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Amazingly the Bible explains that Adam lived until he was 930
                                years old.
                                <br><br>
                                This might seem quite unexpected as the average human lives for around 79 years, but
                                according to the bible, this was
                                his lifespan.<br><br>

                                As this is near impossible, it is debated whether this is literal or symbolic, as it
                                could be perceived as his spirit
                                lived on for 930 years rather than him as a physical being.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The forbidden fruit might not have been an apple.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In the story of Adam and Eve, it says that a forbidden “fruit”
                                was picked by Eve from the tree of knowledge of good and
                                evil.<br><br>

                                But in recent years it has become known that Eve picked specifically an apple from
                                the tree.<br><br>

                                A reason for this could be that the Latin word for evil is “malum” but it is also
                                the same word as apple.<br><br>

                                A Latin translation which appeared in the fourth century AD, first used the word
                                “malum” when describing the tree of
                                knowledge of good and evil.<br><br>


                                It is thought that from this point on people saw the translation meaning evil or
                                apple and then blended the two and
                                associated the evil fruit with being an apple.<br><br>
                            </p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The story of Adam and Eve is different across the world.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Although the story of Adam and Eve tells the tale of eating
                                the forbidden fruit and therefore being exiled from the
                                Garden of Eden, stories of their life up until death vary across countries.<br><br>

                                Ancient versions of the story of Adam and Eve include the Greek Apocalypse of Moses,
                                in Georgian the Book of Adam, the
                                Slavonic life of Adam and the Armenia Penitence of Adam.<br><br>

                                These are known as primary Adam literature, which defines them as original texts and
                                separates them from similar related
                                texts.<br><br>

                                They all have similar key points within the story but they are all unique and
                                creative with the tale.<br><br>

                                All the texts relate to Christian teachings but they all differ in their wording of
                                the story and the length of the
                                text.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It is said that Adam had 6 children with Eve once they left
                                the Garden of Eden, they were called Seth, Cain, Abel,
                                Azura, Awan and Luluwa.<br><br>

                                Four of which were sons and two were daughters.<br><br>

                                In some accounts of the life of Adam and Eve, it is said that they had many

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">According to the story, Adam being the first human contained
                                the souls of every human being to come after him.<br><br>

                                That means that when he had the choice to eat the forbidden fruit, there could have
                                been an influence in his decision
                                from all the souls he contained.<br><br>

                                If that is the case then all 7.5 billion of us today, had an influence on how our
                                world has developed today.<br><br></p>

                                <li>Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit on purpose.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Known as “the fall of man”, it is sometimes debated that
                                eating the fruit was a mistake.<br><br>

                                The reason being, why would you want to risk being exiled from the Garden of
                                Eden?<br><br>

                                But it is suggested that life for Adam and Eve, although almost perfect it was not
                                challenging.<br><br>

                                There was nothing bad, no war, no illness so how were Adam and Eve able to learn and
                                progress as the human race?<br><br>

                                The reasons why they ate the fruit vary across cultures, with the most common being
                                the temptation from the snake.
                                <br><br>
                                Perhaps it was a lesson that had to be learned in order for humanity to
                                progress.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                <li>Both Adam and Eve are saints.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">They are both recognized as saints and on December 24th every
                                year a feast is held in their celebration.<br><br>

                                It has been celebrated since the Middle Ages across Europe including Scandinavian
                                nations.
                                <br><br>
                                That date was chosen specifically as it lies the day before Christmas, the
                                celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

                                The day is to honor and remember Adam and Eve as the creators of mankind.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>It is unknown when Eve died.

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Although across many texts it explains that Adam lived until
                                he was 930, many texts don’t mention Eve.<br><br>

                                It is said that they had their third son when Adam was 130 years old, so you would
                                assume Eve to be the same age as they
                                were both created on the 6th day.<br><br>

                                Many texts explain that they both became old and eventually died from old age and
                                from a tiresome life, but there is
                                still no specific age put to Eve.<br><br>



                                The story of Adam and Eve will be shared with future generations as the story for
                                how mankind was created.<br><br>

                                Although there are scientific oppositions to the creation of the world and mankind
                                the story is a loved tale of
                                temptation and the consequences that must be faced once you have sinned.<br><br></p>
