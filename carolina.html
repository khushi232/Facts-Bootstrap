                                direct descendants of the Paleo-Indians who settled in
                                the Americas.<br><br>

                                These early nomads came into North America from the far east of modern-day Russia
                                into what we now call Alaska via the
                                Bering Strait sometime between 13-11,000 BC.<br><br>

                                Over the next few thousand years, they slowly spread across North America and
                                settled the land.<br><br>

                                The earliest evidence we have of people living in the region we now call North
                                Carolina comes from the Hardaway Site
                                near the center of the state.<br><br>

                                This archaeological site contains evidence of human existence, which dates back as
                                far as 8,000 BC.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It wasn’t until around 1000 BC that the people living in
                                modern-day North Carolina started settling in villages and
                                living sedentary lives around agriculture.<br><br>

                                By the time the first European explorers came upon the region, the people already
                                living there had complex societies and
                                often lived in large, developed towns.<br><br>

                                At the point of contact, there were many tribes in the region, with some of the
                                major tribes including but not limited
                                to the Algonquian-speaking Croatan, Chowanoke, and Roanoke; the Iroquoian-speaking

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It was the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano who first
                                encountered modern-day North Carolina as early as 1524.
                                <br><br>
                                He had set out in the service of King Francis I of France in the hopes of finding a
                                route through to the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>

                                He first made landfall at Cape Fear, just near the border between what is now North
                                and South Carolina.<br><br>

                                From there, he traveled north, making various brief expeditions inland on the way.
                                <br><br>
                                When Verrazzano came upon Pamlico Sound, the expansive lagoon at the mouth of the
                                Pamlico river, he actually believed it
                                to be the way through to the Pacific Ocean and sent his findings back to
                                France.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">By the 1560s, Spain had already laid claims to parts of what
                                we now call South Carolina.
                                <br><br>
                                In 1567 the Spanish explorer Captain Juan Pardo was sent north into the interior of
                                North Carolina to claim the region
                                for Spain and prepare it for a future colony.<br><br>

                                He was tasked with making peace with the local tribes and initiating their
                                conversion to Christianity.<br><br>

                                Pardo’s route took him quite inland to Joara, a Native American settlement close to
                                the present-day town of Morganton.
                                <br><br>


                                The settlement was promptly renamed Cuenca, and a garrison of 30 men was stationed
                                there while Pardo continued his
                                journey.

                                Pardo established six forts in total, all of which were completely destroyed by the
                                displeased locals in 1568.

                                This was Spain’s one and only attempt to colonize the interior of North

                                to come from this early era of colonization.<br><br>

                                We are, of course, talking about the Roanoke Colony. In 1585 the first attempt to
                                establish the Roanoke Colony began
                                when a group of 100 or so settlers landed on the shores of Roanoke Island, North
                                Carolina.

                                The first wave of colonists was to establish a fort on the island and wait for a

                                which ended up being greatly delayed.<br><br>

                                Due to the delays, the colonists gave up on the colony and returned to England when
                                a British ship just happened to pass
                                by.<br><br>

                                When the supply ship returned just a few days later, they found the island empty of
                                colonists.<br><br>

                                So, a small group of men was left behind to guard the fort and the new supplies

                                On August 15, 1587, John’s daughter gave birth to Virginia Dare, making her the

                                Charles is Carolus; thus, the colony was

                                The doughnuts were an instant hit, and many more stores soon opened over the state.

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                Some people would instantly write off North Carolina as yet another southern state,
                                but that just couldn’t be further
                                from the truth!


                                Yes, the state does have a dark number of years which we should never forget, but it
                                also has many great things worthy
                                of praise!<br><br>

                                Where would we be, for example, if Krispy Kreme doughnuts were never invented? Maybe
                                a little less fat, but also not as
                                happy!<br><br>
