                                December 25.<br><br>

                                This 12-day period from December 25 has been treated as sacred and celebrated as the
                                festive season for centuries.
                                Twelvetide, as it was also known, dates as far back as the sixth century.
                                <br><br>
                                In the famous song, on the first day of Christmas, the author’s “true love” sends a
                                “partridge in a pear tree.”<br><br>

                                This line is commonly believed to mean that God (the true love) would send Jesus
                                (the partridge). It reflects the
                                Christian belief that God sent Jesus to be born as a baby on Christmas Day.<br><br>

                                You might still be wondering why, of all the birds to choose from, writer Frederic
                                Austin chose a partridge.
                                <br><br>
                                When looking after its young, a mother partridge will sacrifice her own life for her
                                children. In the Christian faith,
                                Jesus gave his own life to save people when he was later crucified as an
                                adult.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The “second day of Christmas” is also commonly known as Boxing
                                Day in the West. It’s also referred to as the Feast of St
                                Stephen within the Christian faith.<br><br>

                                It is an official holiday in many countries, and Catholics use the day to honor St
                                Stephen, who was martyred in 36 A.D.<br><br>

                                The lyrics in the song include “two turtle doves,” which are reflective of the Old
                                and New Testaments of the Bible.<br><br>

                                Turtle doves have served as a sign of peace, love, and new life throughout
                                history.<br><br>

                                In Christianity, the Old Testament and the New Testament together are thought to
                                complete God’s plan for the world.<br><br></p>

                                The “three French hens” gifted in the Christmas song represent faith, love, and

                                values mentioned in 1 Corinthians, a book of the Bible written by another apostle
                                named Paul.

                                commemorates the baby boys who were killed when King Herod was
                                searching for Jesus.<br><br>

                                In the New Testament, King Herod felt threatened by the new baby Jesus and wanted to
                                find and kill him. He was
                                unsuccessful but ordered all baby boys in Bethlehem under the age of two to be
                                killed instead.<br><br>

                                The day became known as the Holy Innocents’ Day or the Feast of the Holy
                                Innocents.<br><br>

                                The “four calling birds” in our festive song is believed to refer to the four
                                evangelists in the New Testament –
                                Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.<br><br>

                                Each wrote a book of the New Testament in which the title was their own name. They
                                told their versions of the birth and
                                life of Jesus.<br><br>

                                Some historians believe that the song was intended to refer to “collie birds” – an
                                ancient name for the blackbird.<br><br></p>

                                Thomas of Canterbury, most commonly known as Thomas Becket.<br><br>

                                Thomas Becket was one of the most famous martyrs in the world and was murdered on
                                December 29, 1170.<br><br>

                                The “five golden rings” mentioned in the song reflect the first five books of the
                                Bible.<br><br>

                                These five books – Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy – together make
                                up the Pentateuch or Torah.<br><br>

                                day of Christmas” is believed to represent the six days of

                                Christians believe that God created the world and everything within it over six
                                days.<br><br>

                                This story is covered in the book of Genesis, with details of what was created on
                                each of the six days.<br><br>

                                For some Catholics, December 30 is also a day to commemorate Saint Egwin of
                                Worcester, who died in 717.<br><br></p>

                                Gregorian calendar year. The number seven is commonly
                                believed to represent completion and marks a day of rest within many
                                narratives.<br><br>

                                In most countries around the world, this day is now celebrated as New Year’s
                                Eve.<br><br>

                                The “seven swans a-swimming” which appear in the famous Christmas song reflect the
                                seven sacraments of the Catholic
                                church. These are baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, penance, anointing the sick,
                                marriage, and holy orders.<br><br>

                                Swans themselves also have a spiritual meaning since they are thought to symbolize
                                purity and chastity.<br><br>

                                They mate with one partner for life, reflecting monogamy and fidelity.<br><br></p>

                                commonly known as New Year’s Day.

                                In the Catholic church, January 1 is also a day to honor Mary, the mother of

                                On the eighth day of Christmas, the songwriter receives “eight maids a-milking.”
                                This is widely believed to represent
                                the beatitudes – or extra blessings – of Jesus.<br><br>

                                He bestowed these on the poor in spirit, those who mourn, the meek, those who seek
