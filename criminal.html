                                men were killed in a series of matching murders by a
                                killer known as The Doodler.<br><br>

                                All five of the men had similar stab wounds on them, and all five were found around
                                the Ocean Beach area.
                                <br><br>
                                He gained the nickname “The Doodler” as he would apparently sketch his victims
                                before sleeping with them and then
                                murdering them.<br><br>

                                Despite police matching two separate assaults on young gay men to The Doodler case,
                                the killings eventually stopped, and
                                the trail went cold.<br><br>

                                However, public interest was renewed in 2019 after the Golden State Killer was
                                caught in 2018 using new DNA
                                methodologies.

                                The police released a digitally aged composite sketch and audio of an anonymous

                                suspected to be The Doodler, to the public, along with a $100,000 award for news
                                leading to his arrest or capture.<br><br>

                                Apartment Bombings in 1999 between September 4th and September
                                16th, being responsible for 293 deaths in Moscow and Volgodonsk.
                                <br><br>
                                Moreover, these bombings acted as one of the major catalysts for leading Russian
                                into the Second Chechen War.<br><br>

                                Gochiyayev claims he was framed by a former friend who was an FSB officer, although
                                the FSB claimed Saudi-born Chechen
                                terrorist Ibn al-Khattab paid him $500,000 to organize the attacks.<br><br>

                                Whilst Ibn al-Khattab was killed by the FSB in 2002, Gochiyayev managed to slip
                                away, apparently crossing the border to
                                Georgia before possibly fleeing onwards to Turkey.<br><br>

                                in Oakland County, Michigan, between February 1976 and March 1977.<br><br>

                                Out of the babysitter’s four confirmed victims, two were boys, and two were girls –
                                all aged between 10 and 13 – and all
                                went missing outside of their homes.<br><br>

                                Although the police were later able to create a DNA profile of their main

                                The Greater Manchester Police told the Daily Star Sunday newspaper that, between
                                2008 and 2014, they had pulled 85
                                bodies from Manchester’s canals and waterways.

                                Whilst most of these bodies were attributed as accidental deaths, coroners recorded
                                28 open cases where a cause of death
                                couldn’t be established. There was reasonable doubt on the circumstances surrounding
                                these deaths.<br><br>

                                There have been many cases where the parents and families of those retrieved from

                                brutally murdered.<br><br>

                                As the media dubbed him the Phantom Freeway, this serial killer reigned terror and
                                was never caught.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite receiving numerous calls and mail tips, the police task force that was set
                                up to solve the case could never
                                identify anyone as being the person responsible for the killings.<br><br>

                                Each of the five victims’ bodies was found by the side of the I-295 freeway, and the
                                fifth victim, Brenda Woodward, was
                                covered with a coat that contained a chilling note in the pocket, which read:

                                “This is tantamount to my insensitivity to people, especially women. I will admit
                                the others when you catch me if you
                                can!<br><br>

                                <i>Free-way Phantom”<br><br></i>

                                Since the final murder, many of the case files and notes on the Freeway Phantom have
                                been lost.<br><br>

                                This is due to the Washington D.C. Police Department’s antiquated and ineffective
                                policies of case files only being
                                maintained by detectives actively assigned to the case.
                                <br><br>
                                Meaning that the case remains very much unsolved, and the families of the six
                                victims sorely lack any comfort or
                                justice.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Glen Stewart Godwin is a criminal with a storied history.
                                <br><br>
                                Stewart committed an armed robbery with an accomplice where he stabbed a man 26
                                times with a butcher knife before
                                loading the body into a truck and trying to blow it up in the desert using homemade
                                explosives.<br><br>

                                Local residents later found the exploded truck containing the body, and Godwin was
                                eventually arrested and charged with
                                first-degree murder.<br><br>

                                In 1987, Godwin tried to bust out of Deuel Vocational Institute and was moved to the
                                maximum-security Folsom State
                                Prison as a result.<br><br>

                                Although this turned out to work in Godwin’s favor, as he escaped Folsom in June of
                                1987.<br><br>

                                Godwin then made his way south to Mexico, joining a Mexican drug cartel, which
                                eventually landed him back in prison,
                                only this time in Mexico, in 1991.<br><br>

                                While awaiting extradition to the United States, Godwin killed a rival cartel member
                                in prison, stalling his extradition
                                long enough to stage another jailbreak.
                                <br><br>

                                It’s now believed that Godwin is active in illegal drug trade activities in Latin
                                America. <br><br>

                                there without talking about The Zodiac Killer.<br><br>

                                Possibly the most high-profile serial killer to ever exist, and certainly the most
                                well-known to never be caught.<br><br>

                                The Zodiac Killer unleashed terror across the USA with his spree of murders and
                                unbreakable code ciphers that he used to
                                taunt the police and press alike.<br><br>

                                Operating in the San Fransisco Bay Area, the Zodiac Killer targeted known lovers’
                                lanes, often using a firearm or a
                                knife to execute his victims.<br><br>

                                He started his spree in December of 1968, and he was last sighted in October 1969.
                                <br><br>
                                After his killings, Zodiac would tout his handiwork to the press and mock the
                                police’s ineptitude at catching him
                                through a series of coded letters sent anonymously to both the papers and police.
                                <br><br>
                                Only one of which was ever successfully and wholly decoded.<br><br>

                                It was through these letters that he was given the name The Zodiac Killer.<br><br>

                                Even after his killings had stopped, The Zodiac Killer continued writing letters to
                                the press throughout the 1970s,
                                taking a break for a few years before writing his last letter in 1978.<br><br>

                                Despite survivors and witnesses of his attacks giving police matching descriptions
                                that informed an accurate suspect
                                sketch and countless crack teams analyzing the coded letters and trying to solve the
                                case, The Zodiac Killer was never
                                found.
                                <br><br>
                                Maybe, just maybe, he’s still out there today…

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                When you read something like the above, it’s pretty easy to decide you’re never
                                leaving the house. Again. Ever. Or
                                unlocking the windows and doors for good measure.<br><br>

                                But don’t forget – as scary as the world is – you’re still far more likely to be a
                                drunk driver than a criminal on the
                                lamb.<br><br>
