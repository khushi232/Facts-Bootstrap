                            Does one person decide or does it have to go through a number of people before being
                            granted permission to be published?

                            In this article, we will be looking at how a word gets into the dictionary.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">So, how does it get into the dictionary then?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">To put it simply a word gets into the dictionary when it becomes a
                            popularly used word.

                            New words, such as slang and abbreviations are added to the dictionary once they start
                            to appear across a substantial
                            amount of sources and are regularly spoken.

                            Once a word is commonly used and there is an understanding of a common meaning it can be
                            considered to be added to the
                            dictionary.

                            The process is not instant though and can take years to appear in the
                            dictionary.<br><br> </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold ">Who puts a word in the dictionary?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The name of someone who puts together words in a dictionary is a
                            lexicographer.

                            A lexicographer will monitor the usage of a new word, across printed material, online,
                            and spoken word.

                            Firstly they collect information about where the word was written, printed, or heard
                            alongside a contextual meaning.

                            From this, a database of research is created and researchers actively seek the use of
                            the word across different
                            backgrounds.

                            Once adequate evidence has been collated and a solid meaning is found, the word can be
                            put forward to be printed in the
                            latest edition of the dictionary.

                            The Oxford English Dictionary is updated four times a year.<br><br> </p>
                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold ">Is there just one dictionary?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">There is more than just one dictionary, but in English, the Oxford
                            English dictionary is the most reliable and well
                            established.

                            Oxford dictionaries have been around for a very long time, containing around 600,000
                            words and 3 million quotations.

                            When Oxford embarked on creating their first dictionary, they estimated that it would
                            take around 10 years to complete.

                            The word “ant” was reached after five hard-working years and they realized it was an
                            ambitious task.

                            They began work in August 1879 and it wasn’t until 1928 that the final volume was
                            published, taking them almost 50 years
                            to complete.<br><br> </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold ">Can a word be taken out of the dictionary?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">It is very uncommon for a word to be removed from the dictionary.

                            Oxford English dictionaries claim that they have never removed a word from their
                            dictionaries.

                            Instead, if a word has become outdated or the meaning has developed or changed the word
                            will be labeled as obsolete.

                            The concept of the dictionary is to be a record of all words that have ever existed in
                            the language it is documenting.

                            For example, if you are reading a book from 1920 and there is a word you don’t
                            recognize, you can use the dictionary to
                            find out.<br><br> </p>



                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold ">Why was the dictionary invented?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The desire to record language has been around for thousands of
                            years with the first-ever non-alphabetical dictionary
                            being written in 1582 by Richard Mulcaster.

                            This dictionary contained 8,000 English words but the book only contained what were
                            considered to be complex words.

                            Later the first full English dictionary was written in 1604 by Robert Cawdrey. These
                            first books were documents of
                            language and the words used at the time.

                            The idea was to record the English language with word meanings so there was an ultimate
                            record that everyone could have
                            access to.

                            Much later in 1857, the Philological Society of London decided there should be a record
                            of all words that have been used
                            in the English language since the 12th Century.

                            This was when the idea of the Oxford English Dictionaries was born.<br><br> </p>



                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold ">Are more words added nowadays than before?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">On average between 500-1000 words are added to the Oxford
                            dictionary every year.

                            It might feel like more words are added to the dictionary nowadays than compared with
                            the 20th Century, but this isn’t
                            necessarily the case.

                            One possibility is that as our connections and communications have developed, our
                            ability to identify new words has
                            become easier, and therefore it could appear that there are more new words today.



                            In conclusion, any word you can imagine could be added to the dictionary, it just needs
                            to become popular first.

                            Once a word is commonly used across a variety of platforms by a diverse group of people
                            it can then be considered for
                            entering into the dictionary.

                            It also has to have an established meaning, so it can take years for this to become
                            clear.<br><br> </p>
