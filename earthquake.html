                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Across the world we experience earthquakes, some countries more
                            than others, but why is this?<br><br>

                            We know that an earthquake causes the ground to move which can cause destruction to our
                            built-up areas.<br><br>

                            But what causes them in the first place?<br><br>

                            In this article, we will look at the causes of earthquakes around the globe.<br><br></p>
                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What is an earthquake?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">An earthquake is the vibrations of the earth when the surface
                            begins to move as a result of a sudden release of energy.<br><br>

                            This sudden release also known as a seismic wave is caused by movement or a sudden break
                            in rocks underground.
                            <br><br>
                            Most earthquakes occur where the tectonic plates meet or where there are fault lines,
                            but they can also be caused by
                            volcanoes, landslides and explosions.<br><br>

                            They occur specifically when there is a sudden movement of rock in the earth’s
                            lithosphere.<br><br>

                            An example from volcanoes is when pressure is built up under the surface, it needs to be
                            released and this sudden
                            explosion can cause seismic waves, which results in an earthquake.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What do fault lines have to do with earthquakes?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Fault lines are where rock segments under the earth’s surface have
                            experienced fractures.<br><br>

                            Fault lines can vary dramatically; some can be as small as 1-2 inches (2.5-5
                            centimeters) or up to thousands of miles
                            long.<br><br>

                            The state of California has some of the biggest fault lines in the USA, with seven major
                            ones being in the San Francisco
                            Bay area.<br><br>

                            These cracks in the earth’s surface mean that when there is any movement from the
                            tectonic plates, sediment from the
                            rock is likely to break away and fall off which causes an earthquake.<br><br>

                            As the fault lines become bigger, so does the earthquake.
                            <br><br>
                            For example, in California, if there is a slight movement between the Pacific and North
                            American plates this could cause
                            movement and breakages of the rocks with the fault lines.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What is a seismic wave?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">A seismic wave is a name for the energy that travels through the
                            earth’s layers when a sudden movement happens.<br><br>

                            We have been recording earthquakes for over 4,000 years now and in modern-day a
                            seismometer is used to measure these
                            energy waves.<br><br>

                            It does this by recording ground movements and vibrations.<br><br>

                            Not only is it used to locate and predict earthquakes but it is used to study the
                            earth’s internal structure.<br><br>

                            In simple terms, it works to measure the up and down movements of the earth, by using a
                            weight attached to a spring,
                            which will move up and down depending on vibrational movements in the ground.<br><br>

                            A pen is attached which records these movements on paper every time the weight moves.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What is a tremor?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">You may have heard the term “tremor” instead of an
                            earthquake.<br><br>

                            It is the term used to describe a non-earthquake seismic rumble, so anything under a
                            certain size.<br><br>

                            They can sometimes be indicators that an earthquake is coming and these are known as
                            foreshocks.<br><br>

                            However, they are not reliable indicators that something bigger is on its way.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">How do we measure an earthquake?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Earthquakes are measured by magnitude using the Richter
                            scale.<br><br>

                            Charles Richter invented the Richter scale in 1935 and it became the universal way of
                            measuring how strong an earthquake
                            was.<br><br>

                            The Richter scale is a set of numbers that is used to tell the power of an earthquake
                            and is a logarithmic scale.<br><br>

                            For example, an earthquake with magnitude 3.0 is about 10 times the amplitude of an
                            earthquake with a score of 2.0.<br><br>

                            The scale was used alongside a seismometer which could detect earthquakes from around 62
                            miles (100 kilometers) away.<br><br>

                            There is an increase in amplitude by a factor of 10 for each level on the Richter
                            scale.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Is a Richter scale use solely for measuring earthquakes?
                        </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The scale itself can be used to decide how powerful any act which
                            has impacts on the earth’s surface is.<br><br>

                            An example of this can be seen throughout certain events in history that have been
                            recorded using the scale.<br><br>

                            For example, both the Nagasaki Atomic bomb explosion and an earthquake in Lancashire,
                            United Kingdom in 2008 measured
                            the same on the Richter scale.
                            <br><br>
                            Both the above events measured an approximate 5 magnitude on the Richter scale,
                            indicating that 32 kilotons of seismic
                            energy were recorded during these acts.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What country has the most earthquakes?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Japan has experienced the most earthquakes on record.<br><br>

                            This is because Japan sits on one of the most seismic active places in the
                            world.<br><br>

                            The densest seismic network in the world lies beneath Japan, which means it is more
                            likely than other areas to
                            experience earthquakes on a regular basis.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What was the most deadly earthquake to date?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">You might think that the most deadly earthquake of all time would
                            be the biggest, but that isn’t always the case.<br><br>

                            Historically the most deadly earthquake recorded was in China on January 23, 1556, in
                            the province of Shaanxi.<br><br>

                            The powerful earthquake killed around 830,000 people.<br><br>

                            When the Richter scale was invented in the 1930s, scientists predicted what magnitude
                            this earthquake could have been.<br><br>

                            The results from the prediction suggested it would have been between 8.0 to 8.3 on the
                            Richter scale.<br><br>

                            Other factors to its size could make an earthquake more deadly, things like surroundings
                            and safety will reflect the
                            number of deaths from an earthquake.<br><br>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What was the biggest earthquake?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The biggest earthquake on record was the Valdivia earthquake in
                            Chile in 1960, which measured a magnitude of 9.5.<br><br>

                            The earthquake caused a tsunami which, combined killed around 5,700 people.
                            <br><br>
                            The second biggest earthquake on record was the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake which
                            caused a devastating tsunami.<br><br>

                            It measured a magnitude of 9.3 and it ended up killing around 230,000 people across
                            India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and
                            Indonesia.
                            <br><br>
                            An earthquake is the result of the earth’s layers experiencing sudden movement, which
                            causes built-up energy to create
                            seismic waves.
                            <br><br>
                            There is no escaping these monstrous acts of nature but there is a lot we can do to
                            prepare for them.<br><br>

                            As technology has developed, our ability to measure, predict and prepare for earthquakes
                            has excelled in recent years.<br><br>

                            This means that in most cases earthquakes don’t cause as much destruction to humanity as
                            they once did, but that is
                            still no reason to ignore them.<br><br>

                            As long as the earth keeps moving we will always experience earthquakes.<br><br>
