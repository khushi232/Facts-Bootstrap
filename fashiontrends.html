                            any given moment?<br><br>

                            Everybody in the world knows and adores this design, and everyone has to have one at any
                            cost!
                            <br><br>
                            The craze is real. People everywhere anxiously pull away at their shiny paper-covered
                            gifts on Christmas morning, hoping
                            and praying to have that ultimate item!<br><br>

                            But wind forward a year or two later, and it’s totally forgotten about. “Wait, a what
                            now?”<br><br>

                            Let’s roll up our sleeves and take a look at some truly loved but sadly forgotten

                                    Tear-Away pants.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Remember in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when tracksuit
                                pants started sporting snappable buttons, running vertically
                                right along the legs?<br><br>

                                It took me a while to find them, but they were called Tear-Away pants or Snap
                                Pants.<br><br>

                                The design was initially made for basketball and track and field athletes.<br><br>

                                The idea was that they could easily be removed during training when things got
                                heated.<br><br>

                                I remember my pair fondly; many people I knew back then owned at least one pair.
                                They were obsessed! Kappa and Adidas
                                made the two most popular.
                                <br><br>
                                Although the idea was incredible, the novelty wore off quickly because wearing them
                                was a golden ticket for opportunists
                                who would go out of their way to pull at them.<br><br>


                                After the embarrassment of exposing one’s bare legs in public, it took time to
                                replace the buttons. Needless to say,
                                they were banned in my school on non-uniform days.

                                The snap pants were so popular that in the year 2000, Britney Spears chose to sport
                                them at the MTV Music Video Awards.<br><br>

                                As she transitions from her song Satisfaction to Oops I did it Again, she somewhat
                                messily rips off her Tear-Away pants
                                to reveal… well, very little underneath.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Von Dutch Originals has been around since 1999.

                                The unforgettable classic trucker caps soared in popularity immediately after
                                celebrities Paris Hilton, and Nicole
                                Richie wore them in 2003 on their (then popular) TV show called The Simple
                                Life.<br><br>

                                The duo could be seen sporting the famous Von Dutch caps while working as milkmaids.
                                How classy?<br><br>

                                Shortly after that episode was released, the Von Dutch trucker cap TRIPLED in price.
                                Just like that – at the drop of a
                                hat, the Von Dutch cap would set you back $42 to $125.<br><br>

                                Other notable celebrities who wore them include; Jay Z and Justin
                                Timberlake.<br><br>

                                There was a wide selection of designs to choose from, including some very special
                                limited-edition releases.<br><br>

                                Von Dutch Original’s tried to make a comeback in 2016. I take my hat off to them for
                                their efforts, but it never really
                                quite took off like before.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Punk fashion was trendy in the 70s and 80s. The style itself
                                incorporated clothing and accessories, hairstyles, makeup,
                                and even tattoos and piercings.<br><br>

                                British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood revolutionized this subculture trend into
                                a commercialized, more accessible
                                fashion trend that’s still popular today.<br><br>

                                Wearing punk fashion wasn’t just a trend but a true statement. It was all about
                                being unique, different, standing up for
                                something you believe in, or having something important to say.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Denim overalls, or more popularly remembered as dungarees, are
                                generally baggy denim trousers with a bib over your torso
                                and are held together with straps over the shoulders.<br><br>

                                In the wonderfully wild and crazy colorful hip-hop era of the 90s, denim had become
                                a staple in the wardrobes of much of
                                the western world’s younger generation.<br><br>

                                What do you expect when top stars like Queen Latifah, TLC, Tupac, Aaliyah, and even
                                the Spice Girls were all showing off
                                this trend?<br><br></p>

                                were born from sports.<br><br>

                                They were initially designed for basketball players in mind. This is because
                                High-tops rise just above the ankles

                                High-tops became incredibly popular in the 1980s with the release of designs such as
                                Nike Air Forces 1, 2, and 3, Reebok
                                Freestyle, and Nike Air Yeezy.<br><br>

                                Special mention has to go out to the Converse All-Stars. They created their first
                                High-tops in 1917. Converse All-Stars
                                have managed to remain a classic staple in wardrobes around the world today.<br><br>

                                bracelets that have been popular on and off since the 1980s.<br><br>

                                Usually costing just $1 to buy, they came in a wide range of colors and thicknesses
                                to cater to everyone, and you can
                                wear more than one on each arm.<br><br>

                                Jelly bracelets aren’t all just about fashion, as they’re often used to promote
                                charities and encourage awareness.<br><br>

                                The Livestrong Foundation is a non-profit US charity that helps people affected by
                                cancer. In 2004 the charity released
                                a yellow Livestrong wristband, and by 2013 Oprah claimed that a staggering 80
                                million bands had been sold!<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Last – but not least, the Flare (or Bell-Bottoms)! Flares are
                                a type of pant that are tighter at the knee and spread out
                                at the bottom to create a “flare.”<br><br>

                                Would you believe it if I told you that these originated in the early 19th Century?
                                It’s true; they were a top choice
                                for many US sailors!<br><br>

                                But in more recent years, the modern flare was trendy between the 1960s and
                                1990s.<br><br>

                                With the help of Sonny and Cher, they were brought into the mainstream in the 1970s,
                                after wearing them in their popular
                                TV show called Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour.<br><br>

                                There we have it, seven past fashion trends many of us will remember quite
                                well.<br><br>

                                There’s no telling if any of these past trends will make a comeback or not.<br><br>

                                I’ll leave these with you… I’m going to see if I can dig out my old tear-away
                                pants.<br><br></p>
