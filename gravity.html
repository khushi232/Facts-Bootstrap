                            or what it is?

                            Why is something that we can’t see so important to our survival and the workings of the
                            solar system?

                            In this article, we will take a look at what gravity actually is and how it
                            works.<br><br></p>

                        <p class="card-text fs-4">We all know that gravity exists and that it keeps us on the
                            ground, gravity is a force that pulls objects towards
                            itself.

                            <br><br>

                            The word gravity comes from the Latin word gravitas which means weight.<br><br>

                            On Earth, gravity gives objects weight, whereas on the moon the gravity controls earth’s
                            tides.<br><br>

                            Gravity can have many different roles across the solar system; it is the reason why all
                            the planets stay in orbit around
                            the sun.<br><br>

                            Here on Earth gravity is the reason things fall when we drop them, like when we jump, we
                            land back on earth.<br><br>

                            Who discovered gravity?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Sir Issac Newton was an English mathematician and physicist who
                            realized what gravity was when he was thinking about the
                            forces of nature and saw an apple fall from a tree.<br><br>

                            He wondered why the apple fell and then did not move again and recognized that a force
                            must be pulling it down to Earth.<br><br>

                            Newton’s thoughts began to wonder whether this force extended beyond earth and existed
                            in the solar system too.<br><br>

                            In 1632 he put forward the concept of gravity and created the law of gravitational
                            force, which helped other physicists
                            at the time discover the workings of the solar system.<br><br>

                            Before gravity was discovered, the Greeks believed that the solar system was controlled
                            by a god and followed a natural
                            pattern.<br><br></p>

                            How do we measure gravity?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Gravity is measured in what is called a Gravimetry and this
                            measures the strength of a gravitational field.
                            <br><br>
                            The instrument used to measure this is called a gravimeter, and to put it simply it
                            measures the constant acceleration
                            of gravity in a downward direction.
                            <br><br>
                            Experiments using a gravimeter have shown that the gravitational force even varies
                            across the earth’s surface by around
                            ±0.5%.
                            <br><br>
                            This is mostly because of the constant movements of the sun and moon which both affect
                            the gravitational pull of the
                            Earth.<br><br>

                            Gravimeters are mostly to measure the gravitational field for geophysical surveys,
                            mining prospecting, and seismology.<br><br>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Although it is highly unlikely to near impossible that gravity
                            will just disappear, scientists have still tried to
                            predict what would happen without it.
                            <br><br>
                            An article published by the BBC in 2016 explained that if Earth didn’t have gravity, it
                            would most likely break into
                            parts and float away.
                            <br><br>


                            Anything that is not physically attached would be the first to go, things like the
                            ocean, rivers, water would simply
                            float away.<br><br>

                            Followed by the earth itself, the ground would break apart and we would be floating as
                            particles in space.<br><br>

                            A similar scenario would happen with the sun, without the force of gravity to contain
                            its core pressure, it would
                            explode.<br><br>
                        </p>




                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                            What would happen to humans without gravity?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">
                            As we know from astronaut’s experience, living without gravity is not only hard but has
                            negative effects on the body.<br><br>

                            For humans, there would be detrimental effects on our bodies because we have evolved
                            alongside gravity.<br><br>

                            Certain muscle groups are challenged by gravity, simple things such as standing requires
                            muscles to hold us up against
                            gravity.<br><br>

                            NASA astronaut and physician, Jay Buckey has explored how our bodies would react to zero
                            gravity.<br><br>

                            When in space for example where there is no gravity, astronauts lose bone mass and their
                            muscles lose strength.
                            <br><br>
                            This is because without a force pulling against us, we don’t use our muscles, as we
                            would simply be floating.<br><br>

                            This lack of use of muscles and the need to hold yourself upright can cause other
                            effects on the body too, such as a
                            loss of sense of balance.<br><br>

                            The human body has adapted to work with gravity straining our body’s every day and
                            without it, we would slowly
                            deteriorate due to the lack of use of muscles.

                            <br><br>

                            This is the reason astronauts have a time limit on how long they remain in space.
                            Because it is weakening their body,
                            which has consequences when they return to Earth.<br><br>

                            Studies show that if you were to spend around three months in space, without gravity,
                            then it would take two to three
                            years to regain the lost bone density.<br><br>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">You might think that there is little to no gravitational force in
                            water because we float and we feel lighter, but
                            gravity remains the same in water.<br><br>

                            Although the gravitational force in water is the same as on the ground, gravity has to
                            choose what it pulls in.
                            <br><br>
                            When an object or person is placed in water, gravity can still act on the object, but
                            only if an equal volume of the
                            water can go upwards, against gravity.<br><br>

                            This is known as displacement and as a result, gravity has to choose which element it
                            will pull down, the water, or the
                            object.
                            <br><br>
                            Buoyancy is making gravity make this decision and as a result, it will choose whichever
                            has more mass, essentially more
                            weight per given volume.<br><br>

                            If the object placed in water is denser than the water then it will sink and its weight
                            is reduced by the volume of
                            water that is displaced.<br><br>

                            However, if the object is less dense than the water, the object will float up until the
                            point where the mass of the
                            object matches that of the displaced water volume.<br><br>

                            Do all planets have gravity?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Gravity is everywhere, but it is weaker in some places than
                            others.
                            <br><br>
                            For example on Earth, if you weight 100 lb (45 kg), you would be a different weight on
                            different planets.<br><br>

                            The same person would weigh just 17lb (7.7 kg) on the moon, 38lb (17 kg) on Mercury, and
                            253lb (114 kg) on Jupiter.<br><br>

                            As you can see the weight change depending on the planet, but the person remains the
                            same.<br><br>

                            This is because the gravitational force varies between planets and throughout space,
                            causing our weight to be different.<br><br>

                            If there is less gravitational force pulling you to the ground, then you will feel
                            weightless and float, similar to
                            being in a swimming pool.<br><br><br><br>



                            Gravity is highly important to our existence and for the functions of our planet,
                            without it, Earth and the solar system
                            would not be the same.<br><br>

                            So the next time you go swimming, use some weights to test out displacement, or next
                            time you throw a ball, watch the
                            gravitational force pull it back to earth.<br><br>
