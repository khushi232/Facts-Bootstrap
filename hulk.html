                            Here are ten impressive facts about the Hulk that will leave you hunting for

                                <li>The Hulk was originally gray, not green.
                                    <br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The first concepts and drawings for the Hulk were created by
                                artist Jack Kirby, alongside writer Stan Lee.<br><br>

                                Lee wanted the Hulk to be gray so that there were no color associations with any
                                ethnic group or culture.<br><br>

                                The colorist, Stan Goldberg, had problems creating the right look with gray, so he
                                used different shades to emphasize
                                the Hulk’s features. As a result, some of the gray colors had a hint of
                                green.<br><br>

                                Eventually, when the first comic involving the Hulk went to print, the printers had
                                problems re-creating the gray, and
                                the Hulk ended up coming out green.<br><br>

                                However, he wasn’t initially the vibrant green we know today, which was emphasized
                                more over the years.<br><br> </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The Hulk made his debut in 1962.

                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The Hulk first appeared in his debut comic called “The
                                Incredible Hulk,” released in May 1962.<br><br>

                                The Hulk was a new kind of superhero, and sadly his first series of comics were
                                canceled after issue number six.<br><br>

                                This was because the comic wasn’t as successful as others in the Marvel Comic range.
                                However, the Hulk did go on to
                                feature in The Avengers.<br><br>

                                Shortly after, Kirby received a letter expressing his love for the Hulk.<br><br>

                                Kirby realized the audience for the Hulk was college kids, and a new lease of life
                                for the Hulk was born.<br><br>

                                In October 1964, a new comic was scripted to suit its target audience, and the Hulk
                                featured for the first time in
                                almost two years.<br><br> </p>

                                <li>The Hulk was created due to exposure to gamma radiation.

                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The character of the Hulk was developed through an accident.
                                Dr. Bruce Banner was in the process of experimenting with
                                the detonation of a gamma bomb when the incident happened.<br><br>

                                A teen named Rick Jones entered the testing zone, putting him at risk. So Banner
                                entered to save Jones as a bomb was
                                detonating. Banner pushed Jones to safety and consequently was caught in the
                                blast.<br><br>

                                As a result, Banner absorbed a large amount of gamma radiation.<br><br>

                                Banner appeared unhurt until the next day when he transformed into a strong gray
                                creature, which one of the guards
                                deemed as a “Hulk.”<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The red Hulk was introduced in 2008 to the Hulk #1 series.
                                Also known as the “Rulk” or “The IncREDible Hulk,” he was
                                introduced to be the adversary to the original Hulk.<br><br>

                                A key difference with the Red Hulk is that his human identity is kept a secret from
                                other characters in the storyline.<br><br>

                                It was later discovered that the Red Hulk is, in fact, Thunderbolt Ross, who
                                appeared in Hulk #1 in 1962 as a military
                                officer working alongside Banner.<br><br> </p>

                                unique stories of how they came about.<br><br>

                                The She-Hulk was created entirely by accident. Jennifer Walters was a top lawyer and
                                was shot by a mobster. The injury
                                led to her need for a blood transfusion, and Bruce Banner happened to be the
                                donor.<br><br>

                                His gamma-infused blood meant that Walter’s blood was altered, and she too was able
                                to turn into a Hulk.<br><br>

                                Her first appearance was in “The Savage She-Hulk,” which was published in
                                1980.<br><br> </p>

                                This unique and rare gift suggests that she was very close to him and that he felt

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">When Banner was getting used to his new transformation into
                                the Hulk, it was unclear on the cause.<br><br>

                                Initially, it was believed that he only transformed when the sun went down. He then
                                turned back to normal when the sun
                                rose.<br><br>

                                However, after Rick Jones witnessed an experiment, this all changed.<br><br>

                                Thunderbolt Ross attempted to shoot Banner into space against his will. This
                                happened during the daytime, yet Banner
                                still transformed into the Hulk.<br><br>


                                From this, the conclusion was drawn that Banner would turn into the Hulk when he was
                                enraged.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Alongside Thor, Ant-Man, and Iron Man, the Hulk was one of the
                                founding members of The Avengers.<br><br>

                                The first issue of The Avengers was released in September 1963. However, The Hulk
                                left the Avengers in just the second
                                issue, released in November 1963.<br><br>

                                This was because he knew he was unstoppable, and he realized the other members
                                feared his uncontrollable personality.<br><br>

                                The Hulk eventually returned to help The Avengers fight in later issues.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The inspiration for the character of the Hulk came from two
                                iconic characters in the fiction world.<br><br>

                                Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was a significant influence in creating the Hulk with
                                his larger than human size and
                                incredible strength.<br><br>

                                There was also inspiration from the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the doctor who
                                has two personalities, good and
                                evil.
                                <br><br>
                                The combination helped to create the character of the Hulk both for his looks and
                                his characteristics.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                <li>The Hulk is one of few Marvel superheroes to feature on the cover of Rolling
                                    Stone magazine.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Many actors who have played Marvel characters have featured on
                                Rolling Stone, but rarely have the cartoon characters
                                taken the spotlight.<br><br>

                                Rolling Stone magazine first featured the Hulk on the front cover for issue number
                                91, released on September 16, 1971,
                                and again on May 15, 2015.<br><br>

                                One of the main reasons for the Hulk featuring was his personality and attitude, as
                                Rolling Stone promotes this
                                alongside music and musical influence.

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                The Hulk is an iconic character in the Marvel Universe, and he found his place after
                                many years of experimentation.<br><br>

                                Although he wasn’t popular at first, interest in the character grew over the years,
                                and he is now considered an
                                essential character in the Marvel world.<br><br>

                                Unlike other superheroes, his incredible strength and power are initiated through
                                anger, and his stories show his
                                challenges with controlling this.<br><br>

                                As a founding member of The Avengers, the Hulk’s story continues to live on as he
                                helps to save the earth.<br><br>
