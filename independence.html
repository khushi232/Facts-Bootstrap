                            July 4th to many people means flags, freedom, and fireworks. It’s one of the biggest
                            holidays in the United States,
                            celebrated with fireworks, parades, and barbecues.<br><br>

                            It is a day that is steeped in history and tradition.<br><br>

                            Every year, Americans celebrate the anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of
                            Independence in 1776.
                            <br><br>
                            While you may be familiar with basic facts about the holiday, some fascinating facts are
                            lesser-known.<br><br>

                            For example, did you know that the Liberty Bell is tapped 13 times every July 4th? Or
                            that John Adams believed that the
                            Fourth of July was the wrong day to celebrate?<br><br>

                            Check out these 15 interesting facts about Independence Day that will make you see the
                            holiday in a whole new light.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">“Put your John Hancock here.” Have you ever heard that
                                phrase?<br><br>

                                We all know the person is asking for your signature, but why is that a common
                                saying?<br><br>

                                As it turns out, John Hancock, who served as president of the Continental Congress,
                                was the first signer of the
                                Declaration of Independence.<br><br>

                                But it’s not just that. His signature was large, flourishing, and very
                                noticeable.<br><br>

                                It was risky business to sign it – treason, to be exact.<br><br>

                                According to legend, he wanted King George to be able to read it without his
                                glasses, which is why it’s so big.
                                <br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Although the famous document had several notable signatures,
                                two of them would be future presidents: John Adam and
                                Thomas Jefferson.<br><br>

                                After serving as vice president under Washington, John Adams became the second
                                president of the United States.<br><br>

                                Though he didn’t enjoy being vice president and described the role as
                                “insignificant” to his wife, he held the office
                                for two terms and won the presidency in 1796.<br><br>

                                Adams served as president for one term, losing to his vice president in 1800.

                                After serving four years as Adams’ VP, Thomas Jefferson became the third president
                                of the United States.<br><br>

                                He is credited with drafting and being one of the signers of the Declaration of
                                Independence.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The Continental Congress voted on July 2, 1776, to declare
                                independence from England.<br><br>

                                The Congress formally adopted the Declaration two days later, with the Liberty Bell
                                ringing to celebrate the historic
                                event.
                                <br><br>
                                Because the vote took place on July 2nd, Adams believed this should be the day
                                Americans celebrate each year. He said as
                                much in a letter to his wife.<br><br>

                                “The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha in the History of
                                America…”<br><br>

                                While he wasn’t right about the date, he was correct in how Americans would
                                celebrate the occasion each year with “pomp
                                and parade.”<br><br>

                                So stubborn in his belief that July 2nd was the correct date, he declined
                                invitations to appear at events on the 4th of
                                July.

                                However, Adams’ recommendation had little to do with it since fireworks had been
                                part of celebrations in many countries,
                                particularly royal celebrations, for hundreds of years.<br><br>
