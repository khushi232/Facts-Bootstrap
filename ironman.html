                            Iron Man is different from most other superheroes, as he uses his scientific mastermind
                            to create a suit that gives him

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Iron Man’s first appearance in the Marvel Universe was issue
                                #39 of “Tales of Suspense.”

                                Iron Man was also a founding member of the Avengers.

                                It wasn’t until 1968 that Iron Man debuted in his first standalone comic, which was
                                a gamble for Marvel.

                                Marvel was unsure about the popularity of a millionaire becoming a superhero, and
                                Iron Man was a new breed of superhero.<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Original drawings for Iron man have similarities to the
                                character we know, but some unusual additions didn’t make the
                                cut.

                                One of these was jet-powered roller blades that could allow Iron Man to reach speeds
                                of 60 miles per hour.

                                As well as this, in 1974, a nose was drawn onto Iron Man’s mask following a
                                conversation between the illustrator and
                                Stan Lee.

                                After looking at it for a while, it was decided that the nose didn’t look quite
                                right on the mask, and since then, Iron
                                Man’s mask has been noseless.<br><br> </p>

                                each with specific qualities to suit each situation.

                                His first suit was gray and was built to help him escape his kidnapping.

                                Upon his escape, Stark developed suits in more colors; silver and then blue with
                                more features.

                                Iron Man’s suits started with features that gave him the ability to lift up to 100
                                tons (90,718 kg) in weight!

                            Stark created his black suits, which allowed him to enter stealth mode; however,
                            his most famous is his red and gold
                            suit.

                            As well as this range, Stark experimented with suit model number 53 by designing
                            it so it could turn into a flying car.

                            He has also created space suits and aqua suits, allowing him to function in
                            space and underwater.

                                or Iron Woman.

                                Much like Iron Man, Iron Woman relies on her suit for her superhero powers and, has
                                a fiery relationship with Captain
                                America.

                                Their relationship became so heated that Iron Woman became romantically involved
                                with Captain America.

                                The second female Iron Man character was Ironheart, known as her alter ego Riri
                                Williams, who made her first appearance

                                Ironheart made a cameo appearance in
                                May 2016 in Invincible Iron Man Vol. 2 #7.

                                She made her first full appearance in Invincible Iron Man Vol. 2 #9, released in

                                Ironheart is a 15-year-old studying at MIT. She uses stolen materials from campus to
                                re-create a suit similar to that of
                                Iron Man.

                                SHIELD. As a result, he became the seventh known
                                executive director.

                                Agent Maria Hill was the director at the time of the Civil War, but she appointed
                                Stark to lead the team through the
                                war.

                                As a result, in 2007, Hill asked if Stark would become a director as she recognized
                                Stark was more qualified than
                                herself.

                                Stark remained director of SHIELD until 2008, when Norman Osborn took over.<br><br>

                                to his heart.

                                A piece of shrapnel was lodged deep into his chest, just missing his heart.

                                It was a near miss; however, he had to wear a magnetic chest plate to stop the piece
                                of shrapnel from reaching his
                                heart.

                                This plate has to be charged every day; otherwise, Iron Man could die.

                                Although he has an altered nervous system that enhances his ability to heal, it
                                would kill him if the shrapnel moved.<br><br> </p>

                                Hughes.

                                This association allowed the team to form a true likeness in characteristics to a
                                millionaire.

                                In 2013 Forbes published their list of the world’s richest fictional characters.

                                Iron Man, or in his human form Tony Stark of Stark Industries, came fourth on the
                                list with an estimated worth of $12.4
                                billion.

                                Number one on the list was Disney’s Scrooge Duck.<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Every superhero has its evil version, and for Iron Man, his
                                villainous version is called Superior Iron Man.

                                Although Superior Iron Man has the same suit, it is different in color; it’s white
                                and blue.

                                He is a pharmaceutical billionaire who gives away an enhancing drug called
                                “Extremis.”

                                But when he stops supplying it to the world for free and starts charging, he becomes
                                wealthier than ever before.

                                Sadly the people will do anything to get the money to buy it, hence creating a
                                destructive society.

                                The colder-colored suit and evil personality define this villainous version of Iron
                                Man from the original that protects
                                the world.

                                Iron Man was inspired by a real-life millionaire and has stayed true to that persona
                                throughout the Marvel Universe.

                                He is a superhero with the ability to create technologically advanced armor that
                                gives him power and strength to defeat
                                his enemies.

                                Iron Man was the first of his kind, a millionaire superhero, and people fell in love
                                with the character, making him one
                                of the most popular superheroes of the 21st Century.<br><br> </p>
