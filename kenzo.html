                            colors and jungles, but he has also
                            played a huge role in producing a range of fascinating accessories, homewares, and
                            perfumes.<br><br>

                                born on February 27, 1939, in Himeji, Hyōgo, Japan.<br><br>

                                Kenzo sadly passed away on October 4, 2020, after contracting the Covid-19
                                virus.<br><br>

                                As a child, he lived at home with his six siblings and parents, Kenji and Shizu
                                Takada, and the family ran a hotel.<br><br></p>

                                Kenzo went to the Kobe City University of Foreign Studies in Kobe City, but during

                                away.<br><br>

                                This was a wake-up call for Kenzo, who realized he was on the wrong path to
                                achieving his dreams.

                                Yves Saint Laurent was a major role model for him, and after being taught by a

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Kenzo’s impression of Paris wasn’t what he thought initially,
                                and he wasn’t sure if he would stay there for very long.<br><br>

                                He was working for a textile manufacturer as a stylist to tide him over
                                financially.<br><br>

                                He struggled to sell his own designs during this time, and just a few fashion houses
                                were paying him very little for his
                                sketches.<br><br>

                                But then, in 1970, Kenzo happened to have a chance meeting at a flea market with a
                                woman who offered to rent him some
                                working space at Galerie Vivienne.<br><br>

                                With little money to his name, he sourced a variety of mixed fabrics costing just
                                $200, and he used them to create a
                                range of eclectic and bold designs.<br><br>

                                This paid off quickly, and as early as June 1970, he was featured on the cover of
                                Elle Magazine!<br><br></p>

                                tiger face on it.<br><br>

                                Kenzo’s design team was not in favor of it, but it was shown in their Fall
                                collection that same year after some initial
                                resistance.<br><br>

                                Little did they know that the tiger would become the company’s most iconic signature
                                design, one that is here to stay.<br><br></p>

                                announced in early 2016.
                                <br><br>
                                The Kenzo X H&M line was officially brought to stores on November 3, 2016.<br><br>

                                The line was a range of bold and innovative clothes, including a bright green
                                jumpsuit, baseball caps with a leaping
                                tiger logo on them, and a Chelsea boot with a green sole, to name a few.<br><br>

                                The hype was real, and keen eBay sellers were buying up the stock at retail price
                                and selling them for up to seven times

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Kenzo isn’t just known for fabulous clothing as they also have
                                a range of accessories. The company has played a part in
                                homewares and even beauty products too.<br><br>

                                In 1986 Kenzo wanted to create a new perfume, and he met with Serge Manseau, who
                                made perfume bottles.<br><br>

                                During the meeting, he told Mansau that he liked pebbles, and the two began working
                                on sketches to create the perfect
                                design.<br><br>

                                An hour went by when Kenzo further announced that he also liked flowers.<br><br>

                                Mansau found a plastic flower and stuck it on top of the pebbles with a piece of
                                chewing gum, and so his inspiring Kenzo
                                Eau de Toilette was created.<br><br>

                                Having begun back in the 1970s, Kenzo is still one of today’s most popular luxury
                                fashion labels.
                                <br><br>
                                As a Foreign Studies student, Kenzo dropped everything and chased his dreams to work
                                in fashion and live big in Paris.<br><br>

                                A choice that paid off as he lined his pockets, bagging himself a net worth of $100
                                million upon his passing in 2020.

                                May his legacy continue.<br><br>
