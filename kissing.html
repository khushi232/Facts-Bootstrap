                            partner and express that giddy feeling of butterflies
                            they give you.
                            <br><br>
                            Of course, it’s such a normal thing that we don’t even bat an eye anymore when we do it,
                            or see it.<br><br>

                            But like anything else, there’s more beneath the surface about kissing, like health
                            benefits, origins of etymology, and
                            the science of kissing.<br><br>

                            Read on to learn about many people’s favorite hobby, kissing!<br><br>

                                <li>We usually lean to the right when we kiss. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">While your reaction to kissing feels like a natural response,
                                for the most part, our kissing style can be traced back to
                                when we were still in our momma’s stomach!<br><br>

                                The majority of people will tilt their head to the right when they kiss.<br><br>

                                This may seem like a socialized trait, but it actually goes back even
                                further.<br><br>

                                The theory goes, is that we lean to the right because when we were in the womb, we
                                naturally tilted our heads to the
                                right.<br><br>

                                The next time you lean in for a smooch, keep in mind that two-thirds of people will
                                lean to the right, although there
                                may be the occasional left-tilter, so watch out for head bumps!<br><br></p>

                                <li>Kissing uses 146 muscles. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In total, one kiss uses 146 muscles working together. You may
                                think the majority of those are in your face, but
                                actually, 112 of those are postural muscles, and the remainder 34 is various facial
                                muscles.<br><br>

                                Even so, the muscle used the most in a kiss is the muscle around your mouth, of
                                course, called the orbicularis oris.<br><br>

                                How did researchers find out something like this? Well, they studied couples kissing
                                underneath an MRI scanner. Imagine
                                that experiment!<br><br></p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Using the letter “X” as a kiss dates back to the Middle Ages. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Sometimes if you want to be cute and write a love letter to
                                your significant other, you’ll sign it off with “XOXO,” as
                                everyone knows means “hugs and kisses”.<br><br>

                                It seems so normal to us, but no one ever questions the origins of this funky
                                signature.<br><br>

                                Back in the Middle Ages, many people couldn’t read or write. Peasants especially
                                were sadly illiterate.<br><br>

                                So if they had to sign a document, they would write “X” as a substitute for their
                                signature, and then kiss the document
                                as a symbol of honesty.<br><br></p>

                                <li> The world record longest kiss lasted over 58 hours.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">There is a Guinness World Record for the longest-lasting kiss,
                                and it’s insanely high!
                                <br><br>
                                Thai couple, Ekkachai and Laksana Tiranarat held a kiss for 58 hours, 35 minutes,
                                and 58 seconds without a break. If
                                that’s not a symbol of love, I don’t know what is!<br><br>

                                To emphasize this impressive feat even more, the average person spends two weeks of
                                their life kissing – about 20,160
                                minutes in total.<br><br>

                                I imagine the total amount of time kissing by this record-breaking Thai couple must
                                be even higher!<br><br>

                                t-shirts, but where does it come from?
                                <br><br>
                                In Ireland, there’s a place called Blarney Castle, which houses the world-famous
                                Blarney Stone.

                                <br><br>

                                Legend has it, a man named Cormac Laidir had to go to court for a lawsuit, so he
                                asked an Irish goddess for help.<br><br>

                                She told him to kiss the first rock he saw on his way and he ended up winning his
                                case. Cormac took the stone and set it
                                into the parapet of his castle as he believed it to be a lucky stone.<br><br>

                                Based on folklore, if you bend over backward to kiss the stone, you’re rewarded with
                                the gift of eloquence and flattery.
                                <br><br>
                                Originally, it was a legitimate life risk to kiss the stone, as you do so on top of
                                the castle with no safeguard to
                                prevent you from falling off the edge.<br><br>

                                These days, there is a safety barrier, although beware if you’re afraid of
                                heights!<br><br>

                                may be a turn-off if you’re a
                                germophobe.

                                Rest assured, research implies that this bacteria swapping and sharing microbes is
                                good for you and boosts your immune
                                system.<br><br>

                                Worried about your complexion? Kissing can also minimize dermatitis and blemishes on
                                your skin.<br><br>

                                or that lips are like snowflakes in that no two lip impressions are the

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">There are quite a few milestones in the world of on-screen
                                kissing. For example, the first same-sex kiss in cinema
                                occurred in D.W. Griffith’s silent film, “Intolerance” in 1916.<br><br>

                                Not much later, in 1926, “Don Juan” was released which is the film with the most
                                kisses between two people. John
                                Barrymore and Mary Astor kiss 127 times!
                                <br><br>
                                Shortly afterwards, Hollywood started regulating on-screen passion.<br><br>

                                Under what was called the “Hays Code,” which lasted from 1930-1968, two people
                                kissing on screen had to abide by a set
                                of rules.<br><br>

                                Actors were not allowed to be lying down, on-screen married couples had to sleep in
                                separate twin beds, and if the
                                couple kissed in bed, at least one spouse had to have one foot on the
                                ground.<br><br>

                                The first interracial on-screen kiss didn’t occur until the 1950’s on the popular
                                American sitcom “I Love Lucy”.
                                <br><br>
                                Of course, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were married in real life, so perhaps it came
                                as less of a shock value to people.<br><br>

                                <li> A fear of kissing is known as philemaphobia.<br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Afraid to have your first kiss? Many people are nervous at
                                first, which is normal! But there is a phobia for pretty much
                                everything, and kissing is no exception.<br><br>

                                The fear of kissing is officially known as philemaphobia which makes sense, because
                                the Greek word for kissing is
                                “philema”.<br><br>

                                Of course, this can occur not only in young people, but lovers of all ages.

                                Sometimes it may not get better unless you seek therapy!

                                <br><br>
