                            the top brands that come to mind.<br><br>

                            This luxury brand has been around for decades, gaining global fame and becoming one of
                            the world’s most popular names in
                            fashion.<br><br>

                            But apart from being a household name and selling luxury items around the world, what
                            else is there to know about Louis
                            Vuitton?<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Anyone hoping to pick up a discounted bag in the next sale
                                might be very disappointed. Louis Vuitton never has sales,
                                choosing instead to keep products at fixed prices all year round.<br><br>

                                You won’t find any Louis Vuitton outlet stores, and you won’t see this company
                                selling wholesale either.<br><br>

                                The brand warns its customers against buying heavily discounted bags online, which
                                are often counterfeit goods.
                                <br><br>
                                Louis Vuitton isn’t the only company to take this approach. Other labels known for
                                their lack of discounted sales
                                include Apple and Chanel.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Louis Vuitton was founded in 1854 by 33-year-old Louis
                                Vuitton. The first products he made for his new Paris-based
                                company were luggage trunks.
                                <br><br>
                                When Louis Vuitton died in 1892, the business was passed to his son (and only child)
                                Georges.<br><br>

                                Until this point, the brand started to branch out internationally, reaching
                                customers outside of Paris.<br><br>

                                The range of luggage trunks continued to expand, and by the 1930s, Louis Vuitton was
                                also manufacturing smaller bags and
                                purses.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>
                                    Three generations of Vuitton men managed it.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">When Georges Vuitton died in 1936, his eldest son Gaston
                                inherited the company. Gaston became the third generation of
                                Vuitton men to manage the brand.
                                <br><br>
                                Under Gaston Vuitton, the company began manufacturing more smaller bags and luggage
                                items.<br><br>

                                Leather became the primary material in Louis Vuitton products, which the brand is
                                well known for today.<br><br>

                                    A new shape of luggage trunk was born through Louis Vuitton.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Louis Vuitton’s luggage trunks were not the traditional shape
                                and style.<br><br>

                                He was the first designer to create cases with square corners instead of rounded
                                corners. This new design allowed the
                                trunks to be stacked more easily.<br><br>

                                With more effective storage options, customers could take their LV trunks on trains
                                and ocean liners – transportation
                                methods that were very new during the late 19th century.<br><br></p>

                                    The famous LV monogram came after Louis Vuitton’s death.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">While you’d be forgiven for assuming Louis Vuitton himself
                                created the famous LV monogram, it actually came long after
                                he died.<br><br>

                                His son Georges Vuitton created the overlapping “L” and “V” logo in 1896, four years
                                after Louis’ death.<br><br>

                                The simple floral design paid homage to Louis Vuitton and has become one of the most
                                recognized fashion brands in the
                                world.<br><br>

                                The new brand also helped combat counterfeit products and made it easier for Georges
                                to start taking the business
                                globally.<br><br></p>

                                    Georges Vuitton publicly challenged Harry Houdini to escape a new safety
                                    lock.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Before Louis Vuitton’s death, he and his son Georges developed
                                a revolutionary new lock system to help keep their
                                customers’ luggage safer.<br><br>

                                Thieves would often look out for expensive luggage bags by wealthy individuals. The
                                new system made it safer for the
                                customer and more challenging for thieves to break into.<br><br>

                                When Georges patented the system several years later, he publicly challenged
                                illusionist and escape artist Harry Houdini
                                to break out of a luggage trunk.
                                <br><br>
                                Although Houdini did not accept the challenge, it served as a confident
                                advertisement for the new security feature.<br><br>

                                    The company had ties to the Nazi regime during the Second World War.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">After the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, many fashion houses
                                were ordered to close unless they worked with the regime.<br><br>

                                Under the management of Gaston Vuitton, Louis Vuitton did not shut down and worked
                                with the Nazi-backed government.<br><br>

                                Henry Vuitton, the son of Gaston and great-grandson of Louis Vuitton, received
                                awards for his support and loyalty to the
                                Nazi regime.<br><br></p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>
                                    Louis Vuitton bags are almost invincible.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">One of the reasons these luxury bags are so expensive is that
                                they are incredibly durable and strong.<br><br>

                                Louis Vuitton materials can withstand almost all conditions, including heavy water
                                and even fire.<br><br>

                                During the manufacturing process, bags are dropped repeatedly to test their
                                durability. The zippers are opened and
                                closed around 5,000 times.
                                <br><br>
                                However, despite their durable and fireproof nature, end-of-season bags are burned
                                rather than being sold at a discount.<br><br>

                                This helps maintain the high-end and exclusive Louis Vuitton branding.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Everything about Louis Vuitton is seen as exclusive, including
                                the chance to model for the company.<br><br>

                                High-end brands want high-profile models, so it’s no surprise that A-listers Emma
                                Stone, Léa Seydoux, and Alicia
                                Vikander are among the famous faces of Louis Vuitton.<br><br>

                                As well as actresses, Louis Vuitton works with many famous models, including Lauren
                                Case and Kristen Coffey.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">You may be wondering how Louis Vuitton managed to create such
                                a wealthy and high-end clientele for his business.
                                <br><br>
                                He had a lucky break in 1852 when he was asked to work for Joséphine, the wife of
                                Napoleon, Emperor of France.
                                <br><br>
                                Louis Vuitton was Joséphine’s box maker, an experience that enabled his creations to
                                reach royal and wealthy individuals
                                far and wide.<br><br>

                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In the 1960s, actress and model Audrey Hepburn contacted Louis
                                Vuitton, asking the company to make her a mini Speedy.<br><br>

                                The design for “Speedy” was created in 1930 and was initially intended as a travel
                                case.
                                <br><br>
                                But Audrey Hepburn’s love of her new bag made it more popular than ever; today, it
                                is available in different sizes.

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                Louis Vuitton brings decades of history and has come a long way from its humble
                                beginnings.<br><br>

                                Now operating in dozens of countries, LV is one of the most popular brands – not
                                just in the fashion industry but also
                                in the entire world!<br><br>
