                            connection with almost everything across the world.
                            <br><br>
                            You can fall in love with someone, you can do something in the name of love, and you can
                            even love to hate something.<br><br>

                            It’s not only an incredibly versatile word, but a pretty flexible concept too!<br><br>

                            What exactly is love though? And why does everyone go mad about it?<br><br>

                            Science explains it for us in a typically unromantic fashion: We feel the emotion of
                            love when certain hormones are
                            released throughout our body, and when certain regions of the brain such as the
                            hippocampus are activated.<br><br>

                            Boring, right?<br><br>

                            Thankfully for us love has been studied, philosophized, pondered and dwelled upon by
                            hopeless romantics, philosophers,
                            bards, poets, musicians and so on since the dawn of the human race.<br><br>

                            The result? Well, we now we at least know that there are many different kinds of
                            love!<br><br>

                            In fact, ancient Greek philosophers studied the subject and determined that there are 6
                            different forms of love.<br><br>

                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Agápe is considered to be the highest of all forms of love. It
                                has a number of different ways in which it can be
                                interpreted though.
                                <br><br>
                                The word first came into use as a verb in the time of the legendary Greek author
                                Homer, who wrote the Iliad and the
                                Odyssey around the 7th Century BC.<br><br>

                                The meaning of agápe at the time was closer to affection, for example to greet
                                someone with affection.
                                <br><br>
                                The word evolved throughout time though, and is much more closely related to divine
                                love, due to its usage throughout
                                various translations of the Bible.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Keeping with the trend, in the word for “intimate love” in
                                Modern Greek is “Erotas”, and this isn’t a mistake – Éros is
                                the closest thing to what we would call romantic love today.<br><br>

                                This form of love normally ranges from thoughts, desires and actions generally
                                restricted to the bedroom, or dating. But
                                it’s more than that.<br><br>

                                It’s also the love found in marriage, the type of love one has for their other half.
                                <br><br>
                                In fact, Plato believed it to be more the former than the latter, as he saw it
                                without physical bounds or attraction,
                                and thus platonic.<br><br>

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">One of the most common forms of love that we experience on a
                                day-to-day basis is philia, or the love shared between
                                friends.<br><br>

                                This form of love was first defined by the Greek philosopher Aristotle as the love
                                that is shared between friends,
                                particularly in three specific types of friendships.<br><br>

                                The first type of friendship is that which is based on utility, or
                                usefulness.<br><br>

                                This form of philia consists of relationships or interactions between people in very
                                shallow circumstances, such as
                                buying something from someone.<br><br>

                                In modern times we probably wouldn’t refer to this kind of relationship as a
                                friendship, though, more like an
                                acquaintance.<br><br>

                                The second form of philia is much closer to what we would expect of it – it’s
                                entirely to do with taking pleasure in the
                                company of others.
                                <br><br>
                                This could be having a drink together, sharing experiences through a mutual hobby,
                                or simply anything which involves
                                doing something pleasurable with another person.
                                <br><br>
                                The final form of philia, referred to the highest form, is what we would call the
                                love shared between brothers, and true
                                friends.


                                <br><br>
                                It’s the type of philia where you enjoy not just each other’s company, but each
                                other’s character too.<br><br>

                                It’s where you genuinely like the other person, not just because they’re fun to be
                                around.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Storge is a form of love which is said to be the most natural,
                                and is developed as more of an instinct than anything
                                else.<br><br>

                                It is the kind of love which a mother feels towards her child even before it’s born,
                                and it can be said to be what holds
                                families together, no matter what the world throws at them.<br><br>

                                This form of love is almost exclusively experienced between family members, and can
                                either grow or shrink over time
                                depending on how close company they keep.<br><br>

                                One main interpretation of storge which isn’t related to family though can be found
                                amongst the closest of friends.

                                As a friendship grows, the love is closer to philia.

                                As friends become closer, though, and start caring for each other in an almost
                                instinctual way, it can develop into
                                storgic love, where your friends feel like family.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                <li>Philautia – Self love. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Philautia was originally likened to the love one holds for
                                oneself, as well as looking after one’s own happiness or
                                well-being.<br><br>

                                Funnily enough, this wasn’t always considered to be a highly valued form of love,
                                and in fact was considered to be a
                                moral flaw!<br><br>

                                People who practiced philautia were referred to as being vain, selfish, and
                                egotistical.<br><br>

                                Throughout time, though, philautia has gained a better reputation and
                                understanding.<br><br>

                                Gradually philautia, or self-love, began to grow as a concept that is not only good,
                                but extremely beneficial for your
                                mental health.<br><br>

                                The connection between self-love and mental health was first made by a psychologist
                                in 1830, but didn’t take off until
                                the 20th Century.
                                <br><br>


                                Nowadays, self-love is considered to be a vitally important thing, and it’s commonly
                                acceptable to take a day off just
                                to look after yourself!<br><br>

                                When was the last time you had a self-love day?<br><br>
                            </p>



                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Xenia – The love found in hospitality. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">This form of love is less a type of love, and more a general
                                guideline to follow in order to be hospitable to all who
                                pass by your home.<br><br>



                                It is the love which stems from hospitality, and it is one of the oldest and most
                                deep-rooted forms, found all over the
                                world.
                                <br><br>
                                Cultures from opposite ends of the earth all share similarities when it comes to the
                                concept of Xenia.<br><br>

                                The shared traits are generally along the same lines, but start with one main
                                principle: you must honor all who cross
                                your threshold, as well as feeding and sheltering them.
                                <br><br>
                                An example of this can be found in the many myths and legends from pre-Christian
                                religions across Europe.
                                <br><br>
                                In such myths, a deity walks the earth in the form of a human who then travels to
                                different homes testing their
                                hospitality.<br><br>

                                The common theme is that if one treats the guest with honor they receive a reward or
                                gift from the deity, and if they
                                don’t they are punished.<br><br>




                                What we’ve touched on here today is just a drop in the ocean of ways in which we
                                have found to describe the feelings,
                                thoughts and emotions that we define to be love.<br><br>



                                Love seems to be ever so intangible, so hard to get a real grasp of, and as such we
                                will probably keep trying to define
                                for the rest of all time.<br><br>

                                So what is it? I’d say it was best described by John Lennon and Paul McCartney –
                                “Love is all you need”.<br><br>
