                            we’ve never really questioned why.<br><br>

                            It’s become increasingly common to find a household fridge that is covered in some sort
                            of magnet, whether it’s a
                            promotional magnet or a souvenir.<br><br>

                            If you’re a curious person then maybe you’ve stood in front of your fridge and pondered
                            why we use them, and how they
                            came to be.<br><br>

                            We’re going to take a look into the history of fridge magnets and explain how these
                            handy placeholders ended up on our
                            fridges.<br><br>

                            Before we do that, though, it’s best if we quickly refresh what magnets are
                            exactly.<br><br></p>
                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                            What even are magnets?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">For thousands of years now we’ve known of the existence of
                            magnetism, but it wasn’t really until relatively recently
                            that we’ve figured out what it actually is, and how it works.<br><br>

                            Some of the first people to discover that one type of stone would attract other
                            iron-rich stones were the ancient
                            Greeks.
                            <br><br>
                            The first to discover the use of magnetism to point a piece of metal in a constant
                            direction were the ancient Chinese,
                            who used their early forms of the compass to practice Feng Shui.<br><br>

                            So what are magnets?<br><br>

                            By a simple definition, they’re an object that gives out magnetic fields, which in turn
                            attract metals such as steel,
                            iron, nickel, and cobalt.<br><br>

                            Magnets can come in a variety of shapes and forms.<br><br>

                            Some are created by mixing iron and another element such as vinyl or ceramic, which are
                            then magnetized (changed so they
                            also have a magnetic field) by a more powerful magnetic source.
                            <br><br>


                            Another common form of a magnet is an electromagnet, which is a critical component in
                            most types of motors.<br><br>

                            These magnets are constantly being recharged and magnetized by an electric current,
                            which makes them very strong
                            magnets.<br><br>

                            What are magnets used for?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">As we’ve already mentioned, we’ve known about magnets for
                            thousands of years already, with the earliest records dating
                            back to around 2500 years ago in Greece, India, and China.<br><br>

                            By around 1200 AD it was discovered that you could use a magnet to give you a true
                            bearing of north or south, and from
                            this discovery, compasses were born.
                            <br><br>
                            Compasses completely revolutionized how we travel and see the world, allowing travelers
                            to navigate without using the
                            sun or stars, which was generally more unreliable.<br><br>

                            Fast forward to the 20th Century, and magnets were beginning to be used in a wide
                            variety of ways in electronics,
                            motors, and so on.
                            <br><br>
                            How did we start to use magnets on our fridges?

                            <br><br>

                            It wasn’t even until 1913 that the first commercial fridge was invented by a man called
                            Fred W. Wolf.
                            <br><br>
                            Although fridges didn’t see widespread use until General Electric released their
                            “Monitor-Top” fridge in 1927.
                            <br><br>
                            Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t until after fridges were invented that we began to use magnets
                            on them, and this didn’t come
                            until around the middle of the 20th Century.<br><br>

                            It was around this time that it became common to attach a magnet to plastic numbers or
                            letters, which were used as
                            teaching aids.
                            <br><br>
                            The first fridge magnets that were actually designed for the purpose of being used on a
                            fridge were invented by a man
                            called Sam Hardcastle.<br><br>

                            He had been tasked by companies in the space industry with inventing a form of magnetic
                            letters and numbers which were
                            completely magnetic, instead of just being a piece of plastic with a magnet attached.

                            <br><br>

                            Sam Hardcastle created a way to mix iron oxide, essentially iron dust, with vinyl, a
                            slightly flexible plastic.
                            <br><br>
                            He found that the magnets he created suited the purpose perfectly and held onto surfaces
                            much better as the whole of the
                            “magnet” was magnetized.<br><br>

                            Sam realized that his magnets had much more potential and started an advertising company
                            that sold some of the world’s
                            first magnetic fridge advertisements.
                            <br><br>
                            He went on to branch into the souvenir industry by creating specialized magnets for each
                            US state with interesting notes
                            on each of them for the tourism industry.<br><br>

                            Around the time that Sam Hardcastle was developing his fridge magnets, another player
                            stepped into the game.<br><br>

                            A man called William Zimmerman acquired the first patent for a new type of fridge
                            magnets in the 1970s, which were in
                            the form of small cartoons and were quite useful to hold things on fridges.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                            Why are fridge magnets so popular?
                            <br><br>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Fridge magnets rapidly gained approval from the general public
                            around the world.
                            <br><br>
                            Magnets with company advertisements were commonly given out for free, and it was
                            discovered that they were incredibly
                            useful at holding notices, photos, and drawings on the fridge.<br><br>

                            While these were great, more colorful and interesting designs became more and more
                            common, with people decorating their
                            fridges with mementos from all the places they had traveled to.<br><br>

                            In the 1990s a company created a product called magnetic poetry, which included a packet
                            of words on magnetic backing,
                            which could be used to create any sentence you could imagine from the available words.

                            <br><br>

                            The rest? It’s history!
                            <br><br>


                            I don’t know about you, but a fridge isn’t truly your own until you’ve decorated it with
                            a few fridge magnets! And it’s
                            not truly your own until you’ve put a pillow on your fridge…?<br><br>

                            For some, this is all about building up an ever-growing collection of silly colorful
                            fridge magnets from wherever they
                            have traveled.<br><br>

                            For others, fridge magnets are valued more for their usefulness in pinning important
                            messages or family photos to the
                            fridge.
                            <br><br>
                            Whether you’re a fan of blinging up your fridge or not though, fridge magnets are
                            definitely going to be sticking around
                            for a while!<br><br>
