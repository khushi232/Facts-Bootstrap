                            getting ill, injuring themselves, and contracting diseases.
                            <br><br>
                            Physicians have been concocting tinctures and performing surgeries to alleviate these
                            ailments for just as long.
                            <br><br>
                            However, while we are lucky today to be alive in a time of great scientific and medical
                            knowledge, that was
                            unfortunately not always the case.<br><br>
                            Throughout history, going to the doctor was often more risky than just taking your
                            chances with your illness.
                            <br><br>
                            Poor hygiene standards, toxic medicines, and a general misunderstanding of human anatomy
                            all led to some creative,
                            albeit ultimately dangerous, medical practices.<br><br>
                            All too often, the doctor’s cures only ended up causing their ailing patients more harm
                            than intended.
                            <br><br>
                            Anyway, without further ado, here are eight old medical practices that did more harm

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">For hundreds of years, European physicians believed that a
                                whole host of human maladies could be cured by cannibalism.
                                <br><br>
                                Peaking in popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries, doctors prescribed everything
                                from blood to ground-up skulls to
                                their patients.<br><br>

                                When rubbed on the outside of the body, it was believed that human fat could relieve
                                aches and cure gout, while a
                                tincture of ground-up skull mixed with alcohol could help cure epilepsy.<br><br>

                                Consuming fresh blood was thought to aid in general health and vitality.<br><br>

                                Everyone from laypeople to royalty believed in the idea that corpses retained the
                                “spirit” of the person who had passed.
                                Therefore anyone who consumed human remains could gain some of their former
                                strength.<br><br>

                                As gruesome as it might sound, corpse medicine remained a popular course of
                                treatment for centuries, with the last known
                                occurrence happening in 1908.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Today, mercury is known as a potentially toxic element that
                                can be harmful in large doses. However, that wasn’t always
                                the case.<br><br>

                                From the 16th all the way up to the 20th Century, mercury was welcomed as a healing
                                drug and regularly prescribed by
                                doctors and consumed by ill people.<br><br>

                                Because of its purging capabilities, doctors believed that it could cure everything
                                from constipation to parasites, the
                                flu, and even melancholy.<br><br>

                                Calomel, the powdered version of mercury, was prescribed through the 20th Century.

                                However, ingesting mercury can also lead to lung damage and kidney toxicity, and
                                many people undergoing this treatment
                                died of mercury poisoning.<br><br>

                                In this case, the cure really was worse than the disease.<br><br></p>

                                lesson about using potentially toxic elements as a
                                curative tonic. However, that, unfortunately, wasn’t the case.<br><br>

                                Radium, another dangerous element, was commonly mixed with water sold as an
                                over-the-counter “energy” drink in the early
                                20th Century.<br><br>

                                Radium water was marketed under the name brand RadiThor with the slogan: “A Cure for
                                the Living Dead.”
                                <br><br>
                                It claimed to not only improve energy, but could also aid in digestion, increase
                                vitality, and cure impotence in men.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the fact that the adverse health effects of radium were already known as
                                early as 1913, RadiThor remained a
                                popular drink throughout the 1920s, until the federal government forced an end to
                                its production in 1932.

                                patented his famous “Dr. James’s Fever Powder” in 1747.

                                <br><br>

                                Dr. James claimed his concoction could treat any number of ailments, including
                                fever, scurvy, and even distemper in
                                cattle.<br><br>

                                But he was notoriously secretive about the recipe of his fever powder. As it turned
                                out, the secret ingredient was
                                antimony, a toxic metal.
                                <br><br>
                                Antimony was believed to work as a cure-all for any number of ailments, including
                                fever and gout, mainly for the simple
                                reason that it made people vomit.
                                <br><br>
                                In the 18th Century, doctors believed that purging was a sign that the body was
                                ridding itself of toxins and restoring

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Trepanation is one of the oldest medical practices in human
                                history. For over 5,000 years, humans have attempted to cure
                                head pain, skull trauma, and even neurological diseases by drilling holes in the
                                patient’s skull.<br><br>

                                Less extreme versions involved simply scraping or cutting smaller sections of the
                                skull.<br><br>

                                Evidence of trepanation has been found worldwide, including in Europe, China,
                                Russia, and the Americas.
                                <br><br>
                                A modern version of trepanation still exists in medicine, now called a craniotomy.
                                It’s only done to treat extreme
                                conditions, such as a brain tumor, and the skull fragments are immediately
                                replaced.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Arsenic is another very ancient medicine, dating all the way
                                back to Hippocrates. The father of medicine himself used
                                the metalloid to treat ulcers and other sores.<br><br>

                                From ancient Greece to ancient China, arsenic was valued for its medicinal
                                properties.
                                <br><br>
                                It was believed to be able to restore health, and was made into tinctures to treat
                                several diseases, from open wounds
                                and ulcers to sleeping sickness.<br><br>

                                In 1786, an enterprising doctor named Thomas Fowler manufactured his own
                                arsenic-based remedy and began bottling and
                                selling it under the name Fowler’s Solution.
                                <br><br>
                                Fowler’s Solution was sold through the 20th Century as a cure for conditions like
                                psoriasis, asthma, and heartburn, and
                                it was even used in the treatment of leukemia.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">As early as 3,000 years ago, ancient Egyptians pioneered the
                                practice of bloodletting, using a lancet or leeches to open
                                a patient’s veins and draw out their blood.<br><br>

                                The practice spread to ancient Greece and continued to be a popular practice in
                                Europe and America all the way up until
                                the late 1800s.

                                In medieval Europe, physicians believed that the body consisted of four humors:
                                blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black
                                bile.<br><br>

                                If one of these humors were out of balance, the body would become ill.<br><br>

                                Bloodletting was believed to be a solution for any maladies caused by an excess
                                amount of blood in the body, and the
                                practice was used to treat illnesses as wide-ranging as migraines, seizures, sore
                                throats, and even childbirth.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Created by the German physician Franz Anton Mesmer in the
                                1770s, animal magnetism was the belief that the planets exude
                                magnetic rays, which influence human health via an invisible magnetic fluid that
                                permeates the human body.<br><br>

                                Mesmer believed that illness was caused when a person’s magnetic fluid was blocked
                                or unbalanced.
                                <br><br>
                                By using magnets along with certain hand gestures, Mesmer claimed he could unblock
                                an ill person’s magnetic fluid and
                                restore health.<br><br>

                                Animal magnetism, also called Mesmerism, gained popularity in Europe. Wolfgang
                                Mozart and Empress Maria Theresa were
                                among his patients.<br><br>

                                However, Mesmer’s success was also short-lived.

                                <br><br>

                                Following a scandal involving one of his blind patients in 1778, Mesmer’s reputation
                                was ruined, and animal magnetism
                                fell out of fashion.<br><br>

                                However, Mesmerism is also sometimes considered the precursor to a practice that we
                                are all familiar with today: the art
                                of hypnosis.

                                The history of medicine is full of crazy, questionable, and sometimes downright
                                dangerous practices.<br><br>

                                But at the time, most doctors truly believed they were doing the best they could to
                                heal their patients.<br><br>

                                It makes one wonder: what will historians say about our modern medical practices a
                                hundred years from now?<br><br>
