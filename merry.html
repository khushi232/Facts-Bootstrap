                            In fact, an estimated two billion people celebrate this holiday across more than 160

                            biggest holiday in the world and comes with plenty of gifts, music, and food.<br><br>

                            Christmas is an excellent excuse for a party and the optimum time to catch up with

                                and Christians use this day to mark the birth of Jesus.

                                However, this date was never specified in the Bible, and many historians are divided
                                over when Baby Jesus was actually
                                born.

                                Some believe Jesus was born in the spring, while other historians claim it was

                                by almost all Biblical experts that Jesus was definitely not born on December
                                25.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The festival of Christmas may have been inspired by
                                Saturnalia, an ancient Roman holiday celebrated hundreds of years
                                ago in December.<br><br>

                                It was a holiday dedicated to Saturn, a Roman god. People would eat, play music, and
                                give each other gifts.<br><br>

                                By the fourth century, many of the traditions associated with Saturnalia were being
                                celebrated as part of Christmas.<br><br>

                                As time went by, Christmas became the more popular festival and has developed into
                                the holiday we know and love today.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">King Henry VIII is most famous for marrying six wives, and he
                                is less often remembered for introducing us to the
                                Christmas dinner.<br><br>

                                But it is believed that the traditional turkey dinner was first served at the table
                                of King Henry VIII in the 15th
                                Century.<br><br>

                                Over the 300 years that followed, Christmas dinner became very popular in Western
                                cultures.<br><br>

                                Authors like Charles Dickens helped cement the idea of Christmas dinner into
                                society, with novels like A Christmas

                                writing “Christmas.”<br><br>

                                Others believe it takes away the religious connotations associated with
                                “Christ.”<br><br>

                                But there is a much deeper meaning to this abbreviation that doesn’t take away
                                religion at all.<br><br>

                                In this case, “X” is the Greek letter “Chi.” This was the first letter of the Greek
                                word for “Christ,” pronounced
                                “Christos.”<br><br></p>

                                this doesn’t stop millions of people from celebrating the festivities.<br><br>

                                Since 1974, eating KFC on Christmas Day has been a tradition in Japan.<br><br>

                                Instead of eating turkey, chicken is seen as a suitable substitute. As a result,
                                more than three million people enjoy
                                “Kentucky for Christmas.”<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In the popular Christmas song, The Twelve Days of Christmas,
                                the first day of Christmas is December 25. The twelve days
                                of Christmas begin on December 25 and end on January 5.

                                On Christmas Day, the author’s “true love” offers a “partridge in a pear tree.” This
                                is believed to represent Jesus, who
                                sacrificed his own life for his followers in the Christian faith.<br><br>

                                Partridges are known for their willingness to sacrifice themselves for their
                                offspring.<br><br>

                                    Christmas stockings came from a Dutch tradition.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Children worldwide leave out stockings for Santa to fill the
                                night before Christmas.<br><br>

                                This tradition stems from the Netherlands way back in the 16th Century, where
                                children would leave their shoes near the
                                fire. When they woke up, they would find gifts inside their shoes.<br><br>

                                This tradition has developed over the years, and it is now common to leave Christmas
                                stockings by the fire instead.<br><br>

                                Children will often wake up to find their stockings filled with chocolates, oranges,
                                or other “stocking fillers.”

                                    Leaving cookies and milk for Santa dates back years.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">There are several theories about why we leave cookies and milk
                                for Santa Claus.<br><br>

                                Some suggest this began hundreds of years ago when children wanted to give something
                                back to Santa in return for their
                                gifts.<br><br>

                                However, one popular belief is that it began during the Great Depression in the
                                United
                                States. Parents wanted to
                                encourage their children to share with others, so they began to leave food for
                                Father
                                Christmas.<br><br>

                                It also led to the tradition of leaving out carrots for Rudolph and the other
                                reindeers.<br><br>

                                But not all these traditions are followed around the world. In France, for example,
                                people wouldn’t dream of leaving a
                                glass of milk for a grown man.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Elf on the Shelf has become a popular Christmas tradition in
                                recent years. The elf will usually get up to some sort of
                                trouble every night in December and surprise the children when they wake up the
                                following day.<br><br>

                                Christmas Day is the day when Elf on the Shelf returns home. Children might find the
                                elf one last time on Christmas
                                morning before they return to Lapland with the rest of Santa’s helpers.<br><br>
