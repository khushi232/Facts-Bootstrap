                                around 9,200 BC.<br><br>

                                They came from the north and were the direct descendants of the first intrepid
                                explorers who traveled from the far east
                                of modern-day Russia into modern-day Alaska via the Bering Strait.<br><br>
                                These early nomadic people survived off the land, eating what they could gather or
                                hunt.

                                For thousands of years, life continued in a very similar way to this.<br><br>

                                Around 300 BC, people began to farm crops and lived in simple huts called
                                pit-houses.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">These people had learned how to not just live in the harsh

                                They moved from pit houses into permanent planned villages with irrigation,
                                terrace-style farming, and developed complex
                                social structures.<br><br>

                                The Pueblos (as the Spanish later called their towns) were almost always based in
                                highly defensive positions at the
                                edges of cliffs or on rocky mesas.<br><br>

                                Some of these early Spanish explorers reported tales of highly advanced cities
                                within the New Mexico region.
                                <br><br>
                                Fray Marcos de Niza, a Spanish Missionary, became absolutely convinced that these
                                cities were some of several fabled
                                “lost cities of gold.”
                                <br><br>
                                This subsequently led to an expedition led by the conquistador Francisco Vásquez de
                                Coronado into the region between
                                1540 and 1542.

                                the many Pueblo peoples.<br><br>

                                The expedition ultimately found no trace of any cities full of gold and eventually
                                gave up and returned south.<br><br>

                                incredibly mildly.

                                The governors were increasingly greedy, with their main goal in the region appearing
                                to revolve solely around extracting
                                as much wealth as possible from the Pueblo people and their land.

                                Many heinous acts were committed during Spain’s early rule in Nuevo Mexico, ranging
                                from enslaving the Puebloans to
                                outright slaughtering them.<br><br>

                                The last straw to break was when Spain attempted to wipe out the Puebloan
                                religion.<br><br>

                                On August 10, 1680, the northern Pueblo towns rose against Spanish rule, first
                                driving out the colonizers from the local
                                areas before moving in on Santa Fe.<br><br>

                                Santa Fe was besieged by the Puebloans within three days, with all other Spanish
                                settlements lying in ruin.

                                While the Spanish were effectively driven out of the region, they returned in force
                                with much more vicious tendencies
                                twelve years later and retook the land.<br><br>

                                While the invasion was met by little resistance from the Mexican government, that

                                In 1847, local rebels unsuccessfully rose against US rule, killing acting governor

                                camel races.<br><br>

                                Speaking of horses, it’s illegal to wear a kimono while riding a horse in Raton. Oh,
                                and if you trip a horse and it gets
                                hurt, it’s a felony!<br><br>

                                New Mexico is a state that’s forever surprising you.<br><br>

                                Most people would simply pass off the state as hot, dry wasteland and never bother
                                making the trip.
                                <br><br>
                                Anyone that does make it all the way south to this great state is always mesmerized
                                by the deeply complex history, the
                                unique culinary delights, and the straight-up bizarre happenings.<br><br>



                                If you’re looking for a state to knock your socks off, New Mexico is the place to
                                go!<br><br>
