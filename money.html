                            For centuries, money has been spent from the most extravagant to the most mundane
                            things.<br><br>

                            But if there’s one thing for certain about money, it sure is incredibly hard to
                            save!<br><br>

                            Since it’s hard to scrimp for greenbacks, here are ten facts about money that you can

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">We’ve all heard the old idiom “penny for your thoughts;” it’s
                                quite a lighthearted way to be asked what we’re thinking
                                of.<br><br>

                                But back in 1787, the very first American coin to be made was inscribed with
                                something far sterner.<br><br>

                                The Fugio Cent, the copper penny also known as the Franklin cent after its original
                                designer Ben Franklin, had the
                                currency imprinted with “Mind your business.”<br><br>

                                While it is originally said to be more of a literal financial instruction rather
                                than a snarky warning, it is still
                                quite funny to think how it sounds now. </p><br><br></p>

                                talking about greed.<br><br>

                                This age-old saying has become so widely popular that self-styled financial gurus
                                have even actively tried to disprove
                                it.<br><br>

                                Where it originated is really interesting, though, because it came from The Holy
                                Bible.
                                <br><br>
                                In 1 Timothy 6:10 it states, “For the love of money is the root of all evil: which
                                while some coveted after, they have
                                erred from faith, and pierced themselves through many sorrows.”<br><br>

                                Now you have to admit; it is pretty hard to argue against The Holy Scripture!

                                not because of superstition but because of its awkward denomination.<br><br>

                                Its printing was discontinued back in 1966 but was again reinstated in 1976,
                                strangely because the federal government
                                wanted to cut down the number of bills being circulated.</p><br><br></p>

                                Depending on its denomination and the transaction, a bill’s lifespan is surprisingly
                                short, with most of it not even
                                reaching its teens.<br><br>

                                The US Federal Reserve estimates it thusly: with the $1 bill lasting only 6.6 years,
                                the $5 bill 4.7 years, $10 5.3
                                years, $20 7.8 years, $50 12.2 years, and the $100 estimated to last 22.9 years.</p>

                                made out of 75% cotton and 25% linen.<br><br>

                                Back in the days of Ben Franklin, people would even repair torn bills with a needle
                                and a thread.<br><br>

                                Now that’s definitely one way to lengthen money’s short lifespan! </p><br><br></p>

                                edges, and they serve an essential purpose that helps
                                prevent counterfeiting and fraud.

                                The way it works with fraud, such as with coins made out of silver or other precious
                                metals, is it prevents coin
                                clipping where one shaves off the rims and the shavings sold for profit.<br><br>

                                This is barely detectable without the reeded edges and devalues the currency.

                                the shortage of coins.<br><br>

                                Back then coins were still made out of gold and silver, making them far more
                                precious hence why people tended to hoard
                                them.<br><br>

                                The government then decided to address this shortage by letting people pay their
                                debts using postage stamps.<br><br>

                                Funnily enough, though, this too has caused a shortage of stamps.

                                Money has been known to make the world go round, but there’s actually more to it
                                than a crisp piece of paper.<br><br>

                                So the next time you hand over your hard-earned cash at the store, think of these
                                facts and the history surrounding
                                banknotes. <br><br>

                        <p class="fs-4"><span class="fs-1 fw-bold text-primary">#Fact: </span>If axolotls were released
                            into the wild in many
                            states, they could potentially damage the environment.<br><br>

                            Mostly likely endangering native species of salamander, such as
                            the California Tiger Salamander.<br><br>

                            Other states, such as Hawaii, require you to have a permit if
                            you wish to keep one as a pet.<br><br>



                            The axolotl has grabbed our attention for millions of years due
                            to its fascinating regeneration qualities.<br><br>

                            From the Aztecs to the Parisians in the 1800s, axolotls have
                            been admired as a unique species.<br><br>

                            Axolotls have become endangered in the wild due to their natural
                            habitat disappearing. But they continue to thrive in
                            captivity.<br><br>

                            Next time you visit an aquarium, why not see if you can catch
                            one of these curious creatures smiling at you.<br><br></p>
