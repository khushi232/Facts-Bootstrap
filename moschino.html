                                in Italy and the headquarters are in Milan.<br><br>

                                Franco Moschino was born February 27, 1950, in the Lombardy region of Italy which is
                                around 13.7 miles (22km from
                                Milan).

                                Franco Moschino passed away on September 18, 1994, due to cardiac arrest. Franco had
                                suffered from abdominal cancer for
                                some time, but non-the-less his name lives on.<br><br>

                                Today the creative director of the company is American fashion designer Jeremy

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">As a boy, Franco loved going to the iron foundry that his
                                family ran, and his parents had high hopes that he would one
                                day go on to work there himself.<br><br>

                                But Franco set his sights beyond the foundry and had a love for the fine arts and
                                always dreamed of becoming a painter.<br><br>

                                With the pressure mounted on him to work at the foundry, Franco ran away from home
                                in 1968 and enrolled himself into a
                                private school for arts and fashion in Milan called the Marangoni Institute.<br><br>

                                On December 23, 1990, the late Princess Diana wore a red, white, and black
                                houndstooth Moschino suit when taking Prince
                                William to the christening of his cousin.
                                <br><br>
                                This suit later inspired Kate Middleton to wear a strikingly similar red and white
                                coat designed by Catherine Walker
                                during her royal tour of Sweden and Norway in 2018.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                    Moschino’s famous bear logo originated way back in 1988!<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Surprisingly, the famous Moschino bear that we all adore was
                                part of some of Franco’s earliest creations.<br><br>

                                In 1988 Moschino’s fall line featured a model in a black dress with a collar and a
                                hat both made entirely of little
                                bears.<br><br>

                                The little bear logo can be found on many of Moschino’s lines today including the
                                cute and cuddly UnderBEAR range.<br><br>

                                It’s fair to say that he’s here to stay!<br><br></p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>
                                    The Love Moschino brand is really all about love.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">We’ve all seen the Love Moschino brand but perhaps we don’t
                                all know where it came from.<br><br>

                                This brand came about in 2008. Love Moschino is kind of like the fun and energetic
                                younger sibling to Moschino.<br><br>

                                Both men’s and women’s designs have been created under the brand and they all keep
                                in line with Moschino’s usual style,
                                but they add a whole-nother level to it.<br><br>

                                That’s because Love Moschino is all about love, empathy, peace, and unity.<br><br>

                                These lines scream positivity with the creative use of symbols such as love hearts,
                                peace signs, wild colors, and even
                                blinging chains.<br><br>

                                Another bonus – this line costs a little less so is more accessible to the
                                fashion-conscious but bank-broke customer.

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                It’s crazy to think if Franco hadn’t run away from home, Moschino would not be a
                                part of the fashion world we know.<br><br>

                                Franco had a vision beyond working at the family-run iron foundry and chased his
                                dreams to become one of the most
                                influential designers who ever lived.<br><br>
