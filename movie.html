                                His nickname “The Iceman” was given to him as a result of his method of concealing
                                crimes – freezing the bodies of
                                victims to make it difficult to know the time of death.<br><br>

                                Apart from murdering anybody who might say anything against him regarding his
                                crimes, Kuklinski was heavily involved in
                                drugs, arms and pornography.<br><br>

                                With huge secrets hidden away from his family, the movie is based on a true story
                                with law enforcement officers trying
