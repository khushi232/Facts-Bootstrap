                            It has a population of 19,453,561 people (as of 2019), making it the fourth most
                            populous state.<br><br>

                            New York is bordered by the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,
                            Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Jersey.<br><br>

                            With 54,555 square miles (141,300 square kilometers) of land and water, it is the 27th
                            largest state.

                                They crossed from the far east of modern-day Russia into modern-day Alaska and
                                slowly spread throughout the American
                                continent.<br><br>

                                They were predominately hunter-gatherers, and as such, they made their way across
                                the land while searching for better
                                food sources.<br><br>

                                By around 10,000 BC, they reached the region that is now known as New York.<br><br>

                                was an Italian explorer called Giovanni da Verrazzano.
                                <br><br>
                                He was exploring the region on behalf of the French monarchy.<br><br>

                                This was during the early era of naval exploration, and as such, Verrazzano reached
                                the east coast of North America
                                while searching for a fabled sea passage through to the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>

                                In 1524, he passed by New York and sailed into the estuary of what would later be
                                called the Hudson River.<br><br>

                                He made landfall quite near to where New York City stands, a place which he named
                                New Angoulême.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Almost 100 years later, Europeans returned to lay claim to the
                                region.<br><br>

                                The first to do so was the Dutch.<br><br>

                                In 1609, a Dutch East India Company financed expedition led by an English explorer
                                Henry Hudson reached the same estuary
                                Verrazzano did before sailing up the Hudson River (which was later named after him).

                                He sailed upriver as far as modern-day Albany and laid claim to the region for the
                                Netherlands.<br><br>

                                The first Dutch settlement in North America was founded just five years later, where

                                August 27, 1664.<br><br>

                                Britain had decided that the region was theirs, and as such, they sent several
                                warships to lay claims to the area.

                                While George Washington used the word empire, he hardly referred to the state
