                            common answers given would be ninjas.<br><br>

                            Most of what we know about ninjas isn’t that closely based on fact and is heavily
                            influenced by 20th-century literature,
                            comics, and film.<br><br>

                            Something about the mystery surrounding them gets the western world going, but do we
                            really know them?<br><br>

                            We’ve dug up some of the strangest facts about ninjas to help enlighten us all about
                            their shrouded past.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The main word used in Japanese historical documents to
                                describe ninjas was Shinobi or Shinobi-no-mono.<br><br>

                                The word itself predates ninjas themselves and more or less means to steal away or
                                hide, with mono meaning “person.”<br><br>

                                The word ninja comes from how the Japanese kanji characters were read in Chinese and
                                were not used until much later in
                                the 21st century.<br><br></p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The first records of ninjas are from 1375.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The use of espionage was looked down upon in Japanese society
                                for a long time and only really started to gain ground by
                                the 13th century, so any earlier attempts were never recorded.<br><br>

                                The earliest explicit reference to ninjas comes from the Japanese war epic Taiheiki,
                                in which highly-skilled ninjas
                                destroyed a castle.<br><br>

                                A hundred or so years later, espionage was in full swing in Japan, with ninjas at
                                the forefront.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The questionable practices of ninjas were looked down upon by
                                true samurai, who respected honor above all else.<br><br>

                                At the same time, there was always dirty work to be done, so samurai were happy that
                                someone else was prepared to do it.<br><br>

                                In fact, it wasn’t that uncommon for samurai to directly hire ninjas to do jobs that
                                would otherwise bring the samurai
                                dishonor.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In the 15th century, villages in two regions, Iga and Kōga,
                                began to specialize in the ninja ways.<br><br>

                                Multi-generational ninja families appeared and soon made their name as the most
                                professional ninjas around.<br><br>

                                The ninja clans were so good at what they did that anyone else claiming to be a
                                ninja appeared to be more like a common
                                thug.<br><br>

                                The Iga and Kōga clans supplied Japan’s lords with ninjas for nearly a hundred years
                                until a rival warlord all but wiped
                                them out.<br><br></p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The golden age of ninjas lasted from the 15th to the 16th century.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">This was a particularly bloody chapter in Japan’s history
                                books, where warlords all fought to gain control of the
                                country and unify it.<br><br>
                                It’s no coincidence that this period also lined up with the rise and fall of the Iga
                                and Kōga clans.<br><br>

                                Even after the fall of the ninja clans, they were still highly sought after as
                                specialists in covert operations.<br><br>

                                It was only as Japan moved forwards into a time of peace that ninjas began to
                                decline in numbers.<br><br></p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>It’s likely they didn’t even use throwing stars.

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Throwing stars, or shuriken, were certainly used during the
                                period that ninjas were more historically active, but
                                there’s little to no evidence they were even used by ninjas – at least according to
                                surviving ninja manuals.<br><br>

                                Ninjas definitely used a range of specialized tools, and these have been recorded,
                                but throwing stars were more of a
                                samurai thing.<br><br>

                                Either way, they weren’t used in the way we depict them in fiction today.<br><br>

                                Instead, they were most often used as a distraction.<br><br></p>

                                <li>They didn’t always wear black.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">That said, there were strict guidelines on what ninjas should
                                wear, but these guidelines were much more sensible than
                                only allowing them to wear black.<br><br>

                                First of all, a priority was placed on ensuring whatever armor was worn was secured
                                so as not to make any sounds.<br><br>

                                Then, the outfit was based purely on the needs and circumstances of the
                                mission.<br><br>

                                They did wear black on moonless nights but also wore white when there was a full
                                moon.<br><br>

                                When moving about during the day, ninjas wore whatever outfits and colors were in
                                fashion at the time to blend in with
                                the crowd.<br><br>

                                They also regularly disguised themselves as merchants, monks, beggars, or whatever
                                their mission required.<br><br></p>

                                <li>A research center devoted to ninja history was built in Iga.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Mie University has brought back the study of ninja to Iga
                                almost five hundred years after the Iga ninja clans were wiped
                                out, but students won’t be learning how to become ninjas.<br><br>

                                Instead, the ninja studies master’s degree focuses on the history of ninjas, with a
                                few topics on various ninja skills.
                                <br><br>
                                That didn’t stop the degree’s first alumni from working on his martial arts skills
                                and living as close a life to a ninja
                                as possible, though.<br><br>

                                The trouble with finding accurate information on ninjas comes down to two factors:
                                they were secretive, and their
                                specialization was less honorable than samurais, so less scholarly attention was
                                paid to them.<br><br>

                                They’ll remain mysterious for a time, but hopefully, we’ll learn more and more about
                                them in the coming decades!<br><br>
