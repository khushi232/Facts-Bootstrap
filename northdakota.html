                                These early explorers came to the Americas between 12-15,000 BC via the Bering
                                Strait, which at the time was a land
                                bridge between the far east of Russia and Alaska.<br><br>

                                They made their way to the region we now call North Dakota around 10,000 years ago,
                                where they lived primarily as
                                hunter-gathers for thousands of years.<br><br>

                                It wasn’t until around 2000 BC that people began to live more settled lives in
                                villages, although they did not give up

                                developed several distinct tribes and peoples.<br><br>

                                For Dakota, their livelihood still depended on wandering herds of animals such as
                                bison and their predominately nomadic
                                lives.

                                Others, such as the Mandan, settled down entirely and lived year-round in villages
                                along the banks of rivers such as
                                Missouri in houses made of packed earth.<br><br>

                                The villages of tribes such as the Mandan acted as commercial hubs for the other
                                tribes living within the region before

                                The first man who did was the French-Canadian explorer and fur trader Sieur de La
                                Vérendrye when he reached a Mandan

                                through to the Pacific Ocean.

                                When Vérendrye visited the village, it was supposed some 15,000 Mandan people were

                                to west, it makes sense.<br><br>

                                North Dakota is so far inland that European Americans didn’t settle in until
                                railroads started to carve their way
                                through the midwest.

                                As such, it wasn’t until 1861, when Dakota Territory was formed, that white
                                settlement of the area began.<br><br>

                                It wasn’t until 1872, when the Northern Pacific Railway line reached the Missouri
                                River, that migrants started flocking
                                in significant numbers to Dakota.<br><br>

                                Shortly after, in 1889, the states of North and South Dakota were established due to
                                the rapid rise in population.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The first several hundred thousand migrants to start new lives
                                in North Dakota were primarily American citizens.<br><br>

                                Around 1900, the new state witnessed a second population boom which saw its
                                population rapidly increase from 300,000 to
                                646,000 by 1920.<br><br>

                                A vast majority of these new migrants came from Europe, though.<br><br>

                                Most of the European migrants were either Norwegian or German, although there were
                                still many who came from England,
                                Ireland, and Scotland.<br><br>


                                Over the next hundred years, North Dakota continued accepting people of all
                                backgrounds.<br><br>

                                As a direct result, by 1915, 79% of North Dakota’s population were either children
                                of immigrants or immigrants

                                While Dakota Territory could have formed into one larger state, it was more
                                beneficial for the ruling Republican Party
                                to create two states out of the large territory as it would give them more seats in
                                Congress.<br><br>

                                As such, on November 2, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison signed the necessary
                                papers to form the states of North and
                                South Dakota.

                                Despite this, North Dakota is commonly referred to as the 39th state simply because

                                This discovery was significant because it was the first time a dinosaur fossil had
                                been found, including its skin,
                                muscle, and ligaments.<br><br>

                                Usually, only the bones of dinosaurs are found by the time they are fossilized.

                                Rugby quickly claimed the title as their own, erecting a monument in 1931. It turns
