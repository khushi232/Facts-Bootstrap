                            <br><br>
                            Numerology, superstition, important dates, and so many other things cling to various
                            numbers, which in some cases gives
                            them great significance!<br><br>

                            Today let’s take a look at 14 interesting facts about the number 14.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <ol type="1" class="fs-4">
                            <li>The number fourteen is something we call a composite number in mathematics, which is
                                essentially any positive number
                                resulting from multiplying two smaller positive numbers together.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The atomic number of the chemical element silicon is 14. Blue-grey in color, silicon
                                belongs to the 14th group of the
                                periodic table of elements, known as the carbon group. Its pure form, which is
                                incredibly rare on earth, is solid yet
                                brittle and crystalline in nature. It’s most commonly found in impure forms,
                                chemically bound with other chemical
                                elements such as oxygen.<br><br></li>
                            <li>A period of two weeks is also known as a fortnight. Unsurprisingly, a fortnight is a
                                shorthand for fourteen nights. So
                                if you do something every two weeks, you could say that you do it fortnightly. In
                                some countries, such as Australia,
                                it’s common to be paid fortnightly.<br><br></li>
                            <li>In the UK, a person’s weight is often measured in “stones,” while people are
                                measured in pounds in the US. The
                                conversion between the two is quite simple, as one stone weighs the same as fourteen
                                pounds. This, of course, makes zero
                                sense to anyone who uses the much more logical metric system.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The chemical element nitrogen has an atomic weight of about 14. In layman’s terms,
                                atomic weight is a system of
                                measuring the constant weight of a chemical element no matter where it is in the
                                universe, as surprisingly enough, this
                                can actually change!<br><br></li>
                            <li>February 14 is commonly known globally as Valentine’s Day. While these days
                                Valentine’s Day is celebrated by giving
                                chocolates, flowers, or special romantic cards known as “valentines” to your loved
                                one, its roots go back to the Feast
                                of Saint Valentine in the 4th century AD. However, it wasn’t until the 14th century
                                that the day became associated with
                                romance!<br><br></li>
                            <li>The number 14 is, unfortunately, associated with white supremacy. This is because
                                one of the more popular white-power
                                slogans, “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white
                                children,” has fourteen words. While known
                                as the “14 Words,” it is commonly shortened to just “14.”<br><br></li>
                            <li>In the US, the youngest age at which you can be legally emancipated from your
                                parents or guardians is 14. Known as the
                                emancipation of minors, it essentially frees a child of fourteen or older from
                                control by their legal guardians and
                                freeing the guardians of any responsibility towards the minor.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The age of fourteen is also the minimum legal age at which one can begin gainful
                                employment in many states of the US.
                                However, in the UK, at this age, you’re allowed to work only with your parents, on
                                weekdays, in street stalls and the
                                like.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Russia is so huge that it borders 14 countries! These countries are, in no
                                particular order: North Korea, Norway, the
                                People’s Republic of China, Finland, Mongolia, Finland, Kazakhstan, Estonia,
                                Azerbaijan, Latvia, Georgia, Ukraine,
                                Belarus, and finally Lithuania and Poland (via the Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave of
                                Russia).<br><br></li>
                            <li>The 14th president of the USA was Franklin Pierce, who served as President from 1853
                                to 1857. He was a member of the
                                Democrat party, which at that point in time was almost the opposite of how it is
                                today. This actually meant that
                                President Franklin Pierce was for slavery and was a harsh critic of Abraham
                                Lincoln.<br><br></li>
                            <li>One of the most bizarre rules in the game of golf is the limit on how many golf
                                clubs one may carry in their golf bag –
                                which just so happens to be 14. It makes you wonder why this rule had to be put in
                                place and who it was who tried to
                                carry so many with them!<br><br></li>
                            <li>The 13th floor in many buildings around the world is listed as floor 14. This is
                                because many consider the number 13 to
                                be unlucky, so the floors instead go from twelve to fourteen!<br><br></li>
                            <li>There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These territories are, essentially,
                                the last remnants of the British
                                Empire, and in most cases, are islands (such as the Falkland Islands or Bermuda).
                                The British Overseas Territories
                                govern themselves but are still dependent on the UK for foreign relations and the
                                defense of their territory. They all
                                have the Queen of England as their head of state.

                                <br><br>
                            </li>




                        </ol>



                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The number fourteen at first glance is a bit of a nothing number,
                            with no particular significance to anyone.<br><br>

                            While this may be true in a way, when you start to look for it, it pops up
                            everywhere.<br><br>

                            It’s most likely just ignored to a degree as it’s the first number following the unlucky
                            number 13!<br><br></p>
