                            the 17th state to join the United States of America on March 1, 1803.
                            <br><br>
                            It has a population of 11,689,100 people (as of 2019), making it the 7th most populous
                            state. Ohio is bordered by the
                            states of Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.<br><br>

                            With a total of 44,825 square miles (116,096 square kilometers) of land and water, it is
                            the 34th largest state.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It’s widely believed that the Americas were initially
                                populated by a group called the Paleo-Indians.
                                <br><br>
                                They first came to North America sometime between 15-13,000 BC from the far east of
                                modern-day Russia into the
                                westernmost tip of Alaska via the Bering Strait.<br><br>

                                Over the following centuries and millennia, they spread out over the Americas,
                                eventually settling across the continent.<br><br>

                                These early explorers were hunter-gatherers, and all we know of their existence
                                comes from the archaeological evidence
                                we dig up today.
                                <br><br>
                                The earliest such evidence of human existence in the region we now call Ohio comes
                                from unearthed spear tips that date
                                back as early as 13,000 BC.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Ohio’s original Native American tribes were removed from Ohio long before white
                                    people arrived. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">While Europeans may have started to colonize parts of North
                                America as early as 1607, it wasn’t until much later that
                                they reached as far inland as Ohio.<br><br>



                                Until the mid-1600s, Ohio had been more or less continuously inhabited by successive
                                groups of people sharing the same
                                cultures.<br><br>

                                The more well-known of these tribes included the Fort Ancient and Erie
                                people.<br><br>

                                Unfortunately, we know little of many of these earlier tribes as they were soon
                                either wiped out or pushed out of the
                                region by the Iroquois Confederacy, a neighboring confederacy of tribes from the
                                modern-day New York Region.
                                <br><br>
                                Their conquest was a direct result of the newly formed fur trade between the eastern
                                tribes and the recently arrived
                                European settlers.
                                <br><br>
                                By the 1700s, the Iroquois had moved on. The move allowed the tribes from
                                neighboring regions, Shawnee, Miami, and
                                Wyandot, to repopulate the area.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It’s a little unclear which Frenchman it was who first
                                explored modern-day Ohio.
                                <br><br>
                                We know that the famed French explorer and fur trader Robert La Salle explored
                                northeastern Ohio as early as 1669.<br><br>

                                In 1663, France had already claimed the land as a part of the Province of New
                                France.<br><br>

                                France did very little to stake its claim, though. Instead, they established several
                                trading posts and built a few forts
                                to protect them.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">France’s control of Ohio ended when England defeated them in
                                the French and Indian War.
                                <br><br>
                                The land was subsequently ceded to the English in 1763, who immediately proclaimed
                                that it was explicitly reserved for
                                Native Americans, barring colonists from settling further into the area.<br><br>

                                In 1778, during the American Revolution’s first stages, the Virginia colony claimed
                                a large region, including modern-day
                                Ohio, by right of conquest, which they named Illinois county, Virginia.<br><br>

                                Following the United States’ victory in the revolution, Virginia soon ceded their
                                claims to the region and relinquished
                                them to the United States in 1782.

                                Within just 21 years, modern-day Ohio was incorporated into the Northwest
                                Territories and then made into the state of
                                Ohio on February 19, 1803<br><br>

                                vague land survey from 1787, which led the new state of Ohio
                                and Michigan Territory to lay claim to a 438 square mile (1212 square km) strip of

                                Tensions built up over several decades, coming to a head when Michigan applied for
                                statehood.

                                In 1835, the so-called Toledo War broke out, with each side raising a militia to
                                defend their claims.<br><br>

                                The conflict ended with little to no bloodshed when the Federal government
                                intervened.

                                Ultimately, it was decided that if Michigan wanted to achieve statehood, it should

                                strip.<br><br>

                                As we all know, Wendy’s success story didn’t end there. Instead, it expanded into a
                                giant fast-food chain with
                                restaurants worldwide!

                                It’s easy to see that the US wouldn’t be the same without Ohio. Sure, it’s an
                                agricultural powerhouse, but it’s so much
                                more than that!<br><br>

                                Some of the US’ greatest thinkers and politicians have come out of the
                                state.<br><br>

                                There are so many that we’ve only just brushed the surface! The state is more than
                                just its dreamers and inventors,
                                though.

                                It’s also a beautiful state filled with a fascinating history and lively people
                                wherever you look!<br><br>
