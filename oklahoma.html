                            It has a population of 3,956,971 people (as of 2019), making it the 28th most populous
                            state. Oklahoma is bordered by
                            the states of Kansas, Colorado, Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, and Missouri.<br><br>

                            With a total of 69.899 square miles (181,037 square kilometers) of land and water, it is
                            the 20th largest state.<br><br>

                            The capital of Oklahoma is Oklahoma City, which is pretty much square in the middle of

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It’s commonly believed that North America was first settled
                                long ago by a group of people we now refer to as the
                                Paleo-Indians.<br><br>

                                They came to North America sometime between 13-11,000 BC from the far east of
                                modern-day Russia, from which point they
                                crossed the Bering Strait into the westernmost tip of what is now Alaska.<br><br>

                                The Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who spread out all over North America and
                                settled wherever they found ample
                                hunting grounds.<br><br>

                                The earliest records of Paleo-Indian presence within Oklahoma go back to sometime
                                around 11,000 years ago, with evidence
                                of their presence coming from unearthed spear tips and campgrounds.<br><br></p>

                                One of them was the Teyas which disappeared without a trace since European explorers
                                first encountered them.<br><br>

                                Others, such as the Wichita and the Caddo, endured the European invasion of the

                                entourage were the first Europeans to make it as far
                                inland as modern-day Oklahoma.<br><br>

                                Coronado began his expedition in 1540 from the west coast of Mexico, where Spain had
                                established a base.<br><br>

                                Coronado’s venture was to investigate rumors of vast golden cities that were said to
                                be far inland within the modern-day
                                USA.<br><br>

                                Coronado made contact with several tribes, including the Teyas, while passing
                                through the region we now call Oklahoma.

                                Unfortunately for Coronado, there were no cities of gold, and the expedition was a
                                complete and utter failure.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In 1682, the famed French explorer and fur trader René-Robert
                                Cavalier traveled down the Mississippi River from
                                modern-day Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico.

                                In the process of this venture, he claimed the land around the river and all of its

                                Louisiane.<br><br>

                                Although his expedition never actually made it anywhere near present-day Oklahoma,
                                the region was nevertheless claimed
                                by France. France would then control the region from 1682 until 1763.

                                1763.<br><br>

                                Before the war, France had secretly made a treaty in 1762 with Spain, which handed
                                them large portions of the territory,
                                including the Oklahoma region.<br><br>

                                As such, modern-day Oklahoma came under Spanish ownership instead of
                                British.<br><br>

                                Once again, Oklahoma was ignored by its new European stewards, who instead focused

                                through another secret treaty in 1800.<br><br>

                                However, France’s control was short-lived, as Bonaparte was forced to sell this
                                territory to the newly formed United
                                States of America in 1803.

                                Known today as the Louisiana Purchase, the US gained a mind-blowing 828,000 square
                                miles (2,144,510 square kilometers),
                                which more than doubled the fledgling country’s total land.<br><br>

                                This massive swathe of land was partitioned into smaller and smaller

                                Modern-day Oklahoma was first made a part of Louisiana Territory in 1812 (later
                                renamed Missouri Territory), and then

                                By 1854, this region, known as the Indian Territory, had been reduced to the state

                                wished to live. To gain land ownership,
                                one had to live there for five years.

                                One could only enter the region to lay claim to a parcel of land after a specific
                                time. There were, of course, many who
                                broke these rules.<br><br>

                                They would camp out in the soon-to-be-available regions and then claim land before
                                anyone else could get there.

                                biscuits, and gravy.<br><br>

                                That’s not all, though; it also includes sides of corn grits, squash, okra, corn,
                                black-eyed peas, and a good chunk of
                                cornbread.<br><br>



                                To finish the meal, the dessert includes strawberries and pecan pie.<br><br>

                                Depending on what sized portions you allow, the entire meal could contain at least
                                2700 calories (11,296 KJ)!

                                Oklahoma has a pretty troubled past, and that’s an understatement.<br><br>

                                While it’s essential not to forget our darker days or brush them under the carpet,
                                it’s also important to celebrate the
                                good days too!<br><br>

                                The state’s known as one of the cultural centers of the US thanks to its high
                                percentage of Native Americans today, and
                                that’s something to celebrate!<br><br>
