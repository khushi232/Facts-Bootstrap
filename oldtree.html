                            Have you ever wondered what the oldest tree in the world might be?<br><br>

                            Many tree species have become extinct over the years due to climate change, but there
                            are plenty that have survived and
                            still thrive today.
                            <br><br>
                            It has become difficult to determine what the oldest tree is, as there are varying
                            types, species, and ways in which
                            trees grow.<br><br>

                            Here are the seven of the oldest trees in the world that are still alive today.<br><br>

                            This includes both singular trees and clonal colony trees.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4"> Gran Abuelo is located in Alerce Costero National Park,
                                Chile. The tree is the oldest
                                living tree in South America.<br><br>

                                As of 2021, Gran Abuelo was 3,647 years old. Its age means that it was germinated in
                                1,500 BCE.<br><br>

                                Gran Abuelo stands at over 196 feet (60 meters) tall and 13 feet (4 meters)
                                wide.<br><br>

                                It has a perimeter of 36 feet (11 meters).<br><br>

                                Gran Abuelo is a Patagonian Cypress (Fitzroya cupressoids).<br><br>

                                Sadly the Patagonian Cypress is an endangered species.<br><br>

                                This is because the tree contains a resin that slows down the time it takes to
                                deteriorate; therefore it has become a
                                popular building material.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4"> Sarv-e Abarkuh can be found in Abarkuh, Iran.<br><br>

                                The species is a Mediterranean Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) and is believed to
                                be around 4,500 years old.<br><br>

                                Sarv-e Abarkuh is a natural monument in Iran and is protected by the Cultural
                                Heritage Organization of Iran.<br><br>

                                The tree has attracted attention across the world as the legend is that the tree was
                                planted by an Iranian prophet named
                                Zoroaster.<br><br>

                                Other legends tell of the tree being planted by the third son of the Biblical Figure

                                Digain’s Church in the village of Llangernyw, Conway, Wales.<br><br>

                                The tree is a Common Yew (Taxus baccata) species and has existed for around 5,000
                                years.<br><br>

                                This particular tree was aged to be between 4,000-5,000 years old.<br><br>

                                It is difficult to tell the exact age of this species as quite often the core will
                                disappear over time and will be taken
                                over by new large shoots that replace the area the core once was.<br><br>

                                The tree has its own certificate that was issued by English botanist David Bellamy,
                                confirming its age.<br><br>

                                The Llangernyw Yew is an important part of the community as is the heart of local
                                folklore tales.<br><br>

                                The Llangernyw Yew appears in Welsh mythology as the place where the spirit called
                                Angelystor (Recording Angel) will
                                appear each Halloween to tell the village who will die next.<br><br></p>

                                The exact location is unknown to the public as it is surrounded by other ancient

                                This is so the tree stays safe and can be preserved for as long as possible.

                                Up until 2012, Methuselah was the oldest known tree in the world and as of 2021 was

                                It is estimated that the tree would have been germinated in 2832 BCE.<br><br>

                                The tree was named after the oldest Biblical figure Methuselah, who lived to be

                                place around every 600 years.
                                <br><br>
                                The species is a clonal colony tree.<br><br>

                                You might be wondering how you can tell its age if this is the case.<br><br>

                                The age can be seen through the root system, which is dated to be around 9,500 years
                                old.<br><br>

                                It is expected that the tree was brought to the areas by humans to
                                germinate.<br><br>

                                This theory shows that the climate in Sweden may have warmed sooner than scientists
                                once thought.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4"> Jurupa Oak is located in the Jurupa Mountains in Crestmore
                                Heights, California, USA.<br><br>

                                The tree species is a Palmer’s Oak (Quercus palmeri) and was discovered in 2009.
                                <br><br>
                                The species like the Norway Spruce is also a clonal colony tree.<br><br>

                                Its age is determined by the root systems and new shoots are analyzed.<br><br>

                                Palmer’s Oak’s thrive in wetter climates at high altitude, so Jurupa Oak was the
                                only one found to survive in the area.<br><br>

                                When Jurupa Oak was discovered, it was 1.55 miles (2.5 kilometers) wide and had an
                                average height of 3.28 feet (1
                                meter).<br><br>

                                It was also made up of 70 clusters of stems.<br><br>

                                    Pando – 80,000 years old.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4"> Pando is located in Fishlake National Forest, Utah,
                                USA.<br><br>

                                Pando is a Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) and is estimated to over 80,000 years
                                old.
                                <br><br>
                                Not only is Pando the oldest living clonal colony tree in the world, but it is one
                                of the world’s oldest living species.<br><br>

                                Pando is also a clonal colony tree, therefore it may appear to be a cluster of trees
                                above ground but it is linked
                                through its root system which started as one.<br><br>

                                Sadly research shows that Pando’s rate of growth has slowed over the past few
                                decades which indicates that Pando is
                                slowly dying.

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">In Conclusion</h4><br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The 7 oldest trees in the world show how strong and durable
                                nature can really be.
                                <br><br>
                                It is difficult to measure accurately how old a tree can be, as there are many
                                varying factors.<br><br>

                                Some may argue that clonal colony trees don’t count as they re-grow, but it is still
                                incredible to think these plants
                                have been living longer than us!<br><br>

                                Some of the world’s oldest trees have survived and witnessed great events throughout
                                history and they are still standing
                                tall today.<br><br>

                                Why not research what the oldest tree is near you and witness nature at its
                                strongest.<br><br>
