                                North America on November 17.<br><br>

                                The rest of the world had to wait a few months due to delays, with gamers in Europe,
                                New Zealand, Australia, Africa, and
                                the Middle East only able to get their hands on a console by March 23, 2007.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The basic PS3 version, which had a 20GB hard drive, sold at a
                                loss of $US300, with the 60GB version selling for an
                                additional loss of US$240.<br><br>
                                <br><br>
                                While this might seem totally bizarre, it wasn’t that unusual at the time.

                                The idea was that Sony would make up the loss through games and additional hardware
                                sales.
                                <br><br>
                                While the Xbox 360 was also sold at a loss, the loss was only US$130 per console.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">To start with, it was crazy expensive for a console at the
                                time. The 60GB model was US$599, and the 20GB model was
                                US$499.<br><br>

                                Sure, superfans raved on and on about how much potential the PS3 had in terms of raw
                                gaming power, but there just
                                weren’t that many games available at release.<br><br>

                                By the end of 2006, there were only 17 titles available.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The PS3 aspired to be so much more than a way to play games;
                                in many ways, it accomplished that dream.
                                <br><br>
                                A big part of this was that the console had a Blu-Ray player built into it, allowing
                                you to watch your favorite TV shows
                                and movies in full 1080p — providing you were happy to fork out for an expensive
                                Blu-Ray copy of them.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                                    The PS3 also came with a completely redesigned controller.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Dubbed the Sixaxis, the controller was a complete step away
                                from its predecessors.<br><br>

                                The most significant improvement it contained was the ability to use motion-sensing
                                technology.<br><br>

                                This allowed players to use movements of the controller itself to control what was
                                going on in some games.<br><br>

                                That said, it was a downgrade in some ways from the PS2 controller, as it didn’t
                                contain any haptic feedback technology.
                                <br><br>

                                geeks worldwide were excited.<br><br>

                                Not for the gaming possibilities, but due to the equipment inside the console
                                itself.<br><br>

                                Supercomputers at the time were so incredibly expensive that it was actually cheaper
                                and often better to network a bunch
                                of PS3s and use them as one.
                                <br><br>
                                The Air Force Research Laboratory did just this by connecting 1,760 PS3s to 168
                                extra graphics units and 84 servers,
                                nicknaming their project the “Condor Cluster”.<br><br>

                                At its completion, it was the 33rd most powerful supercomputer in the world — no
                                mean feat for a munch of PS3s!

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Previous consoles, including the PS2, touched on this idea,
                                but none were very successful.<br><br>

                                The PS3’s online networking capabilities were much more special because it was
                                completely free.<br><br>

                                This became a significant selling point for the console when Xbox Live, a paid
                                service, was announced.<br><br>

                                You could even surf the web on your PS3 if you wanted to!
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>
                                    There were three main PS3 models.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The first model, often referred to as the PS3 “Fat”, was the
                                least acclaimed due to its price and lack of games at
                                release.
                                <br><br>
                                It was also incredibly chunky compared to the later models, hence its
                                nickname.<br><br>

                                The following model was the PS3 Slim, released on September 1, 2009. It was wildly
                                popular in comparison to the first
                                model.<br><br>

                                It wasn’t just slimmer – it had better storage capabilities, weighed less, used less
                                power, and was quieter than its
                                predecessor.<br><br>

                                The final model was the PS3 Super Slim, which was released on September 28, 2012.
                                <br><br>
                                While sleeker and lighter, it wasn’t as popular as the PS4’s release was already on
                                the horizon.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>
                                    The first PS3 was backward compatible.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Unfortunately, It was only available on the first version of
                                the PS3 model.
                                <br><br>
                                We’re not exactly sure why, but Sony decided it wasn’t worth putting the hardware
                                into later versions of the console to
                                allow people to play PS2 games.<br><br>

                                Later models had the option to play PS2 and PS1 games but not game discs — the games
                                had to be bought through the PS
                                Store.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>
                                    More than 87 million PS3 consoles were sold worldwide.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">This might seem like a pretty high number, but it pales next
                                to the 140 million PS2 units sold.<br><br>

                                In fact, in 2008, Sony’s CEO Kaz Hirai announced in an interview that the company’s
                                goal was to sell more than 150
                                million units.<br><br>

                                Maybe they would have achieved their goals if the original launch hadn’t been such a
                                flop.<br><br>

                                The PlayStation 3 was a complete game-changer, not just for Sony but for console
                                gaming overall.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite its initial setbacks, it was at the forefront of gaming technology and paved
                                the way for all future consoles,
                                Sony or otherwise.<br><br><br><br>



                                If you’re a PC or Xbox fanboy, you should be able to agree on one thing in this
                                article, and that’s the fact that the
                                PS3 showed the world what a real gaming console could do.
                                <br><br>
