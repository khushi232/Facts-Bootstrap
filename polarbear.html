                            by humans, but by polar bears!
                            <br><br>
                            Russia has over 50 polar bears across its northern region, where it meets the Arctic.
                            <br><br>
                            So, why were so many entering villages at once?
                            <br><br>
                            Let’s have a look at why these ice dwellers made an invasion of Russia.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Polar bear sightings in Russia aren’t common. </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Russia has over 50 known polar bears living in and around the
                            North, where the country meets the Arctic.<br><br>

                            It is not common for polar bears to come onto land as they are ice-based
                            creatures.<br><br>

                            They live on the frozen waters, as this is where the majority of their food sources
                            are.<br><br>

                            During the cold winter months, they need to stock up on fatty foods that are high in
                            protein in order to survive the
                            harsh environments.
                            <br><br>
                            But in 2019, dozens of the fierce bears came onto land, disrupting a village and looking
                            for alternate food sources.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  "> The archipelago of Novaya Zemlya was invaded.</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The chain of islands called Novaya Zemlya were the victims of this
                            mass invasion.
                            <br><br>
                            On February 16, 2019, a state of emergency was called by Arkhangelsk Oblast authorities
                            as dozens of polar bears were
                            seen entering inhabited areas, including homes and civic buildings.<br><br>

                            With only a total population of 3,000 people, the islands were under attack from polar
                            bears who were searching for food
                            sources.
                            <br><br>
                            Local inhabitants became scared to leave their homes in fear of sending their children
                            to school or kindergarten in case
                            a polar bear ate them.<br><br>

                            A local report said that at least 52 polar bears invaded the main settlement of Belushya
                            Guba.<br><br>

                            Alexander Minayev, a local administrator, reported that between 6-10 bears had entered
                            buildings in the area.<br><br>

                            Head of the local administration, Zhigansha Musin, said that there had not been this
                            many polar bear sightings or quite
                            an invasion since 1983.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Specialists were deployed to help the situation. </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The situation was getting out of hand, and people were being
                            chased down the streets by the unruly bears.<br><br>

                            In fear of their lives, a specialist team was called in to save the villagers after an
                            unsuccessful attempt to scare the
                            polar bears off with patrols of vehicles and dogs.<br><br>

                            Russian law states that it is illegal to hunt and shoot polar bears, so specialists from
                            the Russian environmental
                            authority were deployed to remove the polar bears in a non-harmful way.<br><br>

                            The law against hunting has been in place since 1956 as polar bear numbers were
                            declining at a rapid pace.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  "> Global Warming is destroying habitats.</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">In the mass polar bear invasion of Russia, footage from locals
                            showed polar bears searching through the local dump and
                            garbage piles for food sources.
                            <br><br>
                            Due to climate change, ice caps are melting at a decline of 13% every decade, which
                            means the polar bear’s habitat is
                            being destroyed, and their food sources are becoming scarce.<br><br>

                            Along with this, an estimated 22,000-30,000 polar bears live in the wild worldwide; that
                            is a lot of re-homing to do.<br><br>

                            As a result, polar bears have to relocate and adapt their diet to their
                            surroundings.<br><br>

                            Although polar bears won’t actively seek out humans to eat, they are drawn to built-up
                            areas as they have garbage dumps
                            which are initial food sources for bears to find.<br><br>

                            Realistically these garbage piles are not sustainable for polar bears to be able to get
                            enough proteins, so it results
                            in them attacking humans because they are hungry.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Russia is invaded a second time in the same year. </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Later on, in December 2019, another polar bear invasion happened
                            in Russia.<br><br>

                            This time located in the North East, where Russia joins Alaska by ice where the sea
                            freezes over in the winter.<br><br>

                            In this case, over 60 polar bears were loitering in Ryrkaypiy, in the Chukotka
                            region.<br><br>

                            All activity was halted, and locals were encouraged to stay inside for their own
                            safety.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">In Conclusion </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">LThese astonishing events, which were scary encounters for the
                            locals of the Novaya Zemlya islands and the Chukotka
                            region, will not be forgotten.<br><br>

                            Although we can’t stop nature or change how the wild behaves, we all have an impact on
                            our surroundings, and we can
                            shape the future of our planet.<br><br>

                            Why not look into your carbon footprint and see what you can do to help slow down global
                            warming, as you might be saving
                            the polar bears!<br><br></p>
