                            Queen Elizabeth II is the longest-reigning British monarch in history, having reigned
                            over the Commonwealth since 1952!
                            <br><br>
                            The world has certainly changed during her time as the Queen of the United Kingdom and
                            the Commonwealth.<br><br>

                            Reigning throughout World War II, she witnessed the change to the metric system, the
                            currency of the United Kingdom, and
                            has seen the world’s population increase almost threefold!<br><br>

                            The Queen has used her unique position to promote peace and charity in everything she
                            does.
                            <br><br>
                            This has led to her being one of the world’s most well-known, admired, and influential
                            women in history.<br><br>

                            Queen Elizabeth II’s good works are no secret to us all but do lead many to believe she
                            is merely a figurehead. Here are
                            ten powers that the Queen of England has.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <ol type="1" class="fs-4">

                                <li>Queen Elizabeth II can travel without a passport.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">When traveling overseas, Queen Elizabeth II does not require a
                                British passport.<br><br>
                                As all British passports are issued in the name of Her Majesty, it wouldn’t make
                                much sense for her to issue herself
                                one!<br><br>

                                Other members of the Royal Family, such as the Prince of Wales, still require a
                                passport to travel overseas.<br><br>

                                With well over 60 million people living in the United Kingdom, the Queen is unable
                                to issue such a large quantity of
                                passports each year.<br><br>

                                She now has several ministers working to issue all passports on her behalf to solve
                                this issue.
                                <br><br>
                                The Queen traveled to over 120 different countries on almost 300 foreign trips;
                                she’s certainly making the most out of
                                being the only person in England who can travel passport-free!<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The Queen doesn’t need a driver’s license.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Like passports, British driving licenses are also issued in
                                her name only. This means that she is able to drive without
                                the need for a driver’s license.<br><br>

                                She began driving when she was just 19 years old, back in 1945. Even at this young
                                age, she knew her way around a car.<br><br>

                                When she turned 18, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service during WWII and
                                trained as a truck driver and a
                                mechanic.<br><br>

                                Although she is often driven around by selected members of her Royal staff now, it’s
                                not uncommon for her to drive
                                herself on her own private land or find a nice place to take her Corgies for a
                                walk.<br><br></p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>The Queen is the only person to have the power to appoint the elected Prime
                                    Minister for the UK.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">As the Head of State, Queen Elizabeth II must remain neutral
                                on any political matters.<br><br>

                                Whilst having the right to vote – or stand – in any election, she still maintains
                                her neutral stance.
                                <br><br>
                                Why is this? The Queen is responsible for appointing the Prime Minister after a
                                general election or resignation.<br><br>

                                She chooses the candidate with the most support from the House of Commons.<br><br>

                                During Queen’s reign, there have been 14 British Prime Ministers and 14 US
                                Presidents, 13 of whom she has met in person.<br><br>

                                <li>The Queen has the power to veto any bill passed through Parliament.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Parliamentary bills follow a strict path through the upper and
                                lower houses, which conclude with royal assent.<br><br>

                                This means that the Queen must approve a bill before it becomes law.<br><br>

                                If she disapproves? It’s simple; it doesn’t become law!<br><br>

                                Whilst Queen Elizabeth II can veto any bill that comes her way, an occasion has
                                never arrived where she has needed to
                                invoke her power.<br><br>

                                In fact, the last time such power was used was in 1708 when Queen Anne withheld her
                                support for a bill to restore the
                                Scottish militia.<br><br></p>

                                powerful capabilities on this list, but it’s why we have
                                chosen to include it!<br><br>

                                The right to claim ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open waters can be dated
                                back to the twelfth century! Back in
                                these times, swans were often used as prized food, often served at banquets and
                                feasts.<br><br>

                                Back then, if you injured or killed a swan without permission from the monarch, you
                                could face severe penalties for your
                                actions.<br><br>

                                Stealing a swan egg alone could land a hefty sentence of one year and a day in
                                prison.<br><br>

                                The monarch’s rights of ownership of swans were often granted to people by the
                                monarch.<br><br>

                                As of today, there are only three organizations that have retained their right of
                                ownership of mute swans.<br><br>

                                Abbotsbury Swannery was granted the right of ownership way back in the fourteenth
                                century. Two London livery companies,
                                the Vintners and the Dyers, have held similar rights since the fifteenth century.
                                <br><br>
                                Today swans are no longer eaten by the British public and have become a protected
                                species. So you may be thinking, is
                                this now a dead law? Well, not exactly.<br><br>

                                The law relating to the ownership of mute swans isn’t specific to live birds alone.
                                <br><br>
                                Dead swans also fall under this protection, and therefore anyone wishing to use a
                                swan for taxidermy or educational
                                purposes must receive permission from The Queen’s Swan Marker.<br><br>

                                You are forbidden to sell the dead swan for profit if your wish is granted.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Queen Elizabeth II has the power to give anyone a “Royal

                                sentence.<br><br>

                                The original purpose of a Royal Pardon was to provide an exemption from the
                                now-abolished death penalty.<br><br>

                                With this being said, in 2001, the Queen used her power to shorten the sentences of
                                two inmates in HMP Prescoed (A
                                prison in the south of Wales) after they saw a wild boar attacking a person working
                                in the jail and jumped in to help
                                him.<br><br>

                                The heroic acts of these two men saved the life of the farm manager

                                For this, the Queen granted them a lesser sentence, and they were both released
                                early from prison.
                                <br><br>
                                A more recent example of the Queen exercising this power was in 2013 when she
                                granted Alan Turing (The father of
                                modern-day computing) a posthumous royal pardon — a pardon after the man’s death in
                                question.<br><br>

                                Alan Turing was a computer pioneer and codebreaker during WWII. His amazing work on
                                the Enigma Machine provided vital
                                assistance to the Allies during the war.<br><br>

                                Sadly, Alan Turing was convicted of homosexuality, and his security clearance got
                                revoked. He was then placed under
                                house arrest.<br><br>

                                Alan Turing died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning.<br><br>

                                member of the Royal Family to join the Armed Services full time.<br><br>

                                Since then, the Queen has maintained her close relationship with the Armed
                                Forces.<br><br>

                                All soldiers within the British Armed forces are under the command of the

                                In practice, she has little to do with the military, and offloads the responsibility

                                In 1999, the Queen refused to give her consent for the “Military Action Against Iraq

                                This parade has marked the official birthday of the British Sovereign for well over
                                250 years now!<br><br>

                                This spectacular parade consists of over 1400 soldiers, 200 horses, and 400
                                musicians!

                                People from all over the world flock to the streets of London to be a part of the
                                celebrations.<br><br>

                                Her actual birthday is a much quieter affair, with a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park, a
                                62-gun salute at the Tower of London,
                                and a small 21-sun salute in the Windsor Great Park.<br><br>

                                She usually celebrates this birthday with her close family, and sometimes even has a
                                walkabout outside the Windsor
                                Castle, greeting fans, and collecting her birthday cake!<br><br><br><br>
