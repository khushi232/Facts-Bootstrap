                                The first reference to reindeer pulling a sleigh came in 1821.<br><br>

                                New York printer William Gilley published a collection of seasonal poems for
                                children aged 5-12, including poetry
                                referencing a reindeer pulling a sleigh.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Saint Nicholas had been a part of Christmas traditions since
                                as far back as the 13th Century. But the character of Santa
                                Claus, with his bright red outfit and lively style, appeared much later.<br><br>

                                The version of Santa that we know and love today evolved over decades.<br><br>

                                Christmas poems and tales painted a picture of a jolly man with a white beard
                                descending the chimney to leave gifts for
                                well-behaved children.<br><br>

                                A sleigh pulled by adorable, hard-working reindeer brought even more magic to the
                                revised story of Santa Claus. By the
                                1920s, Coca-Cola had started using Santa Claus in its marketing.<br><br></p>

                                It mentioned gifts – described as “rewards” – being delivered on Christmas Eve,
                                rather than Saint Nicholas Day on
                                December 6.

                                anonymously released A Visit from St. Nicholas.<br><br>

                                It became commonly known as The Night Before Christmas.<br><br>

                                This 1823 publication, which first appeared in a New York newspaper, was claimed
                                fourteen years later by American writer
                                Clement Clarke Moore.<br><br>

                                It had a significant influence on developing modern-day Christmas tales and
                                traditions, including Santa’s reindeer.<br><br>

                                It was the first time multiple reindeer had been named in a Christmas story.<br><br>

                                Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder, and Blixem were officially
                                introduced into the history books.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The original names of Santa’s reindeer in 1823 included Dunder
                                and Blixem. Today, these reindeer are commonly known as
                                Donner and Blitzen.
                                <br><br>
                                There are conflicting accounts of how the names of these reindeer came to be
                                changed. “Dunder” and “Blitzen” are Dutch
                                for “thunder” and “lightning.”
                                <br><br>
                                An 1837 poem by Charles Fenno Hoffman was renamed the reindeer Donder and
                                Blixen.<br><br>

                                Some speculate that Blixen was chosen to rhyme with Vixen, although the rationale
                                for the change to “Donder” is less
                                clear.
                                <br><br>
                                When Clement Clarke Moore included the 1823 poem in an 1844 publication of his own,
                                Blixen became Blitzen, and the name
                                Donder was adopted.<br><br>

                                The story of how Donder later became Donner is unknown.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">While most of Santa’s reindeer were introduced in the early
                                19th Century, Rudolph took more than 100 years to appear.<br><br>

                                In 1939, a department store in Chicago wanted a “cheery” new Christmas character.
                                They asked one of their staff, Robert
                                Lewis May, to write a children’s book.<br><br>

                                May worked in advertising and took on the challenge despite his wife being
                                terminally ill with cancer.<br><br>

                                After around 50 hours of work, Robert May had created Rudolph the Red-Nosed
                                Reindeer.<br><br>

                                Millions of copies of the new book were bought and given away to customers.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">This cute Christmas character has become an integral part of
                                the festive season.<br><br>

                                In 1949, a decade after Robert Lewis May first created him, Rudolph the Red-Nosed
                                Reindeer became the title feature of
                                the Christmas Number 1 in America.<br><br>

                                Singer-songwriter Johnny Marks took inspiration from the 1939 children’s book penned
                                by his brother-in-law.<br><br>

                                His song was introduced on New York Radio by American crooner Harry Brannon.<br><br>

                                Chuck Berry continued the tradition by releasing Run Run Rudolph in 1959. The
                                following decade, a special animation was
                                released featuring Rudolph and was developed into a series over 15 years.<br><br>

                                To celebrate 75 years of Rudolph, limited-edition postage stamps were available in
                                America in 2014.<br><br></p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Santa’s reindeer are all female.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Male reindeer shed their antlers after the mating season is
                                over, while female reindeer retain theirs.<br><br>

                                Since the mating season is in the fall and finishes by early December, reindeer seen
                                at Christmas with antlers would
                                most likely be female.<br><br>

                                Males use their antlers to fight during mating season. If male reindeer are
                                castrated, however, they would not typically
                                shed their antlers.<br><br>

                                But there is another piece of evidence that suggests Santa’s reindeer are
                                female.<br><br>

                                Male reindeer have around 5% body fat, while females have up to 50%. This keeps them
                                much warmer in sub-zero
                                temperatures – like pulling Santa’s sleigh through the air during winter.<br><br>
                            </p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Some people think Santa has many other reindeer.

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The original eight reindeer, plus Rudolph, have well and truly
                                been cemented into society. But that doesn’t stop popular
                                culture from suggesting Santa has other reindeer.<br><br>

                                Santa’s sleigh was shot down in a 2002 episode of the TV show “South Park.” Eight
                                new reindeer, including Horace,
                                Skippy, and Steven, formed a backup team.<br><br>

                                In the 1962 song, “Santa is Watching You,” Ray Stevens lists the original reindeer
                                plus George, Bill, Fred, Queenie,
                                Bruce, and others.<br><br>

                                Santa’s reindeer have a heritage that dates back decades. Now a key part of the
                                holiday season, Rudolph and the original
                                eight reindeer can brighten up any Christmas.<br><br></p>
