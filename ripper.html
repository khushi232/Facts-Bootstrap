                        <p class="card-text fs-4">By no means was Jack the Ripper the first serial killer. However,
                            until this madman struck, his was the first case to
                            stir up a worldwide media frenzy.<br><br>

                            Even over 100 years later, everyone knows his nickname, and the mystery surrounding
                            these attacks are scrutinized.
                            <br><br>
                            And that’s the million-dollar question: Who was Jack the Ripper?<br><br>

                            If you were clicking on this article for a big reveal, unfortunately, we can’t give that
                            to you.<br><br>

                            No one can for certain! But we can take a look at his profile and the most likely
                            suspects.<br><br>

                            Guess who it was as much as you’d like, but don’t expect a definitive answer from
                            anyone.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">The Profile of a Killer.</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">If you didn’t already know, Jack the Ripper was an unidentified
                            person who committed a string of horrific serial murders in 1888.<br><br>

                            His signature included mutilation or dismemberment of the victims who were all
                            women.<br><br>

                            Due to the fact that he seemed to only target alcoholic prostitutes, authorities
                            assessed that he was likely a male seeking easy prey.<br><br>

                            As they put the pieces together, it was also figured that he was either abused or
                            deserted by his mother when he was a child.<br><br>

                            This was the most likely reason why he only killed women.<br><br>

                            Based on the time of the murders, there are a few extra details we can
                            ascertain.<br><br>

                            The killings typically took place on the weekends, and only ever between the hours of 12
                            AM and 6 AM.<br><br>

                            These facts break down to mean two things: he probably had a job, but was single and had
                            no family ties.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">How the cases tied together.</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">During the time of the Ripper killings, there was already a high
                            amount of violence against women occurring in the same
                            area.<br><br>

                            In those days, the East End of London was considered the slums. A large number of
                            attacks and murders happened
                            specifically in the poverty-stricken district, Whitechapel.<br><br>

                            A string of 11 murders occurred between April 1888, and February 1891. They were all
                            performed in terrible methods, but
                            five of them, in particular, were able to be tied together.<br><br>

                            These women are considered the canonical five of Jack the Ripper. Any other victims are
                            speculation and unable to be
                            confirmed.<br><br>

                            The other five women were considered acts of gang violence. Similarly, no one was caught
                            for these crimes either, so it
                            is impossible to rule out Jack the Ripper for these as well.<br><br>

                            However, the canonical five all shared the same detail: they were killed by their
                            throats being slit.<br><br>

                            For four of them, other awful wounds and mutilations were inflicted.
                            <br><br>
                            But for the other, she only had one laceration and it is theorized that the Ripper may
                            have been interrupted before he
                            could carry out any other abominations.<br><br>

                            Even though these five had a connection, there is still no sure way to tell if Jack had
                            other victims or not.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">The Search for a Maniac.</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">During this hunt, over 2,000 people were interviews, 300 plus were
                            investigated, and 80 were detained.
                            <br><br>
                            It was determined by the lacerations on the victims, that the killer had knowledge of
                            human anatomy and thus could
                            potentially be either a butcher or work in the medical field.<br><br>

                            As a result, 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and the examination of all the
                            employees included the last 6
                            months.<br><br>

                            The case remained open until 1892 when the authorities officially closed the file based
                            on lack of evidence and success.<br><br>
                        </p>



                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">The Unusual Suspects.</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Today, there are over 100 hypotheses regarding Jack the Ripper’s
                            true identity. Those who study about Jack the Ripper
                            are called “Ripperologists”.<br><br>

                            Their theories range from people like Winston Churchill’s dad, the author of Alice in
                            Wonderland, Lewis Carroll, and the
                            grandson of Queen Victoria.<br><br>

                            Some have even speculated that Jack the Ripper was in fact Jill the Ripper.<br><br>

                            Specifically, one Mary Pearcey was caught and executed in 1890 for butchering her
                            lover’s wife and child in a similar
                            style to the Ripper.
                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, there isn’t enough surviving forensic evidence about the case to
                            determine any of these theories.
                            However, we can narrow it down to the top 5 most likely.<br><br>
                        </p>



                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Was it Montague John Druitt?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Starting with bachelor number one! Montague John Druitt didn’t
                            have any scientific or concrete evidence convicting him,
                            but the timeline of his life is eerily close.<br><br>

                            Druitt lived only a few miles away from the location of the murders in Whitechapel, and
                            it was reported that he was seen
                            in the area around the same time as the Ripper murders.<br><br>

                            Even though he was a well-educated man coming from Oxford, many believed him to be
                            “sexually insane” which would be a
                            factor in the mutilations of the women.<br><br>

                            The biggest factor for believing it was Druitt, is the fact that Druitt’s body was found
                            just seven weeks after the
                            probable last victim of Jack the Ripper.<br><br>

                            He was found at the bottom of the River Thames, his death ruled a suicide. Is it
                            possible that after Montague’s last
                            strike, he went fully insane and killed himself?<br><br></p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Was it Carl Feigenbaum?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">While experts believe Jack was in his mid-20’s to mid-’30s, this
                            next suspect is an exception.
                            <br><br>

                            murders.<br><br>

                            While docked in the area, he was usually spotted at nearby brothels to add to the
                            possibility.
                            <br><br>
                            Even worse, he was known to be a psychopath and confessed to mutilating women. Even his
                            own lawyer was convinced his
                            client was Jack the Ripper!
                            <br><br>
                            Around 1890, Carl emigrated to America where he was convicted of murdering a woman and
                            sent straight to the electric
                            chair.<br><br>

                            Ripperologists say there are many prominent likenesses to the Ripper murders and Carl’s
                            victims in the States.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Was it Francis Craig?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Recently, many people have come to believe that the Ripper was in
                            fact the husband of one of the victims.<br><br>

                            Francis Craig was a reporter during the murders, covering the police courts and
                            investigations on crimes in the East End
                            where the murders took place.
                            <br><br>
                            Some have suggested that Craig had a personality disorder, such as schizotypal.
                            <br><br>
                            He only lived a few minutes away from the first murder scene of Jack the Ripper, which
                            gives him the convenience of
                            killing in his area.<br><br>

                            Craig married Elizabeth Davies, who is believed to have an alias for being a prostitute
                            – Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the
                            Ripper’s last victim.<br><br>

                            Ripperologists say that when Craig found out his wife was working as a prostitute, he
                            started planning her murder.<br><br>

                            He only killed the four other women in order to cover up his involvement.<br><br>
                        </p>



                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Was it Walter Sickert?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Walter Sickert was notorious for painting prostitutes. Some say he
                            would add clues and symbols into his artwork about
                            the Jack the Ripper killings.<br><br>

                            Professionals claim that the resemblances are so similar to the real crime scenes, that
                            only the real murderer could
                            have painted them.<br><br>

                            While there is less evidence against him than some of the other accusations, the
                            similarities of his painting are too
                            close to ignore.<br><br></p>



                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Was it Aaron Kosminski?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">There are many highly-regarded police officers that hold firm to
                            the polish barber, Aaron Kosminski as being the Ripper.<br><br>

                            Russian-born, Kosminski moved to London in the early 1880s and was living in Whitechapel
                            during the murders, working as
                            a hairdresser.<br><br>

                            In fact, he was known to be misogynistic with homicidal tendencies and was sent to an
                            asylum in 1889.<br><br>

                            During the murders, Aaron was among the few primary suspects.<br><br>

                            A witness even said he was the person attacking one of the victims, however, they
                            declined to testify. There was never
                            any hard evidence, so an arrest was impossible.<br><br>

                            One thing that has always tied Aaron to the killings, is a shawl that was found at the
                            scene of one of the victims,
                            Catherine Eddowes.
                            <br><br>
                            The shawl was covered in blood and it was originally thought to be Catherine’s.<br><br>

                            However, one researcher claims that the quality was too expensive to have been owned and
                            worn by a London prostitute of
                            that time.<br><br>
                            <br><br>
                            Meaning: the shawl may have belonged to Jack the Ripper.

                            Later, the fabric was found to have been made in Russia. During the time of Kosminski
                            living in Poland, it was under
                            Russian control and normal for Russian goods to be traded there.<br><br>

                            Additionally, Aaron’s mitochondrial DNA was found on the shawl.<br><br>

                            However, that doesn’t to much in the case of proving anything, because this type of DNA
                            is likely to match with many
                            other people’s.<br><br>
                        </p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  " So who done it?></h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Based on the information above, who do you believe to be the most
                            likely suspect?<br><br>

                            Personally, it’s hard to ignore that Druitt killed himself shortly after the last
                            victim, but with all the evidence
                            against the other men, it’s difficult to narrow down.<br><br>

                            It is widely believed that after the final killing, the Ripper stopped due to his death,
                            imprisonment, emigration, or
                            institutionalization.<br><br>

                            We will probably never have a definitive answer to this question, but it is still
                            fascinating to research.
                            <br><br>
                            Whoever Jack the Ripper was is long gone, and only he will ever know the full
                            truth.<br><br>
