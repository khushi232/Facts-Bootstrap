                            Have you ever wondered what effects running has on our bodies or why sometimes we just
                            feel the need to run?<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">There have been many record-breaking speeds humans have run
                                for both long-distance runs as well as sprints.
                                <br><br>
                                In 2009, Usain Bolt broke the world record for the fastest 100-meter sprint,
                                completing it in only 9.58 seconds.
                                <br><br>
                                Running speeds are measured by meters and time, meaning that Bolt’s record-breaking
                                run was 10.44 meters per second.<br><br>

                                That’s equivalent to 23.35 miles per hour.<br><br>

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It’s often debated whether running barefoot is good or bad for
                                you, and it does really depend on the situation.<br><br>

                                Running barefoot is better for us as humans because it is more natural. It’s said to
                                create better balance and improve
                                strength.<br><br>

                                We evolved with the skill of running, and our ancestors wouldn’t have run in
                                shoes.<br><br>

                                However, some risks come with running barefoot. Due to the lack of protection, you
                                risk puncturing skin by running on
                                something sharp.<br><br>

                                This will also put more stress on the bottoms of your feet, and this may cause more
                                damage over time.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Running is a natural trait of humans or any animal that has a
                                predator. Running would have been the most common form of
                                escape, whatever animal you were being chased by.<br><br>

                                As well as running from things, running is essential for catching food.
                                <br><br>
                                The ability to run has been developed as an evolutionary trait over the years. Let’s

                                catch food were more likely to survive.<br><br>

                                Over 80% of injuries caused by running are due to repetitive stress.<br><br>

                                This is when a minor injury develops but isn’t really noticed or doesn’t cause too
                                much pain. Therefore it is easily
                                ignored.

                                Unfortunately, the injury doesn’t have time to recover or heal and gradually
                                worsens.

                                Endorphins release stress and pain when they interact with receptors in the brain.

                                Humans are developed enough to start running from the age of 18 months old.<br><br>

                                way to get the body pumping and burn some calories.<br><br>

                                The amount burned varies depending on whether your run has any elevation gain and
                                the surface you are running on.
                                <br><br>
                                These factors could make your run harder, so you will use more energy.
                                <br><br>
                                It also depends on your health and weight. Generally, if you weigh more, you will
                                burn more calories than someone who
                                weighs less when running simultaneously.<br><br>

                                This is because calories are essentially energy, so the heavier you are, the more
                                calories are needed to move the extra
                                weight.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">We often think of world record runners as young athletes, but
                                as long as you are in good shape, there’s nothing stopping
                                anyone from running.<br><br>

                                The world’s oldest marathon runner was 101-year-old Fauja Singh, who ran the London
                                Marathon in 7 hours 49 minutes.<br><br>

                                Although he broke multiple records, none of these were formally recognized.<br><br>
                            </p>

                                <li>The average running speed of women is around five miles per hour. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Humans can run slowly in the form of a jog or sprint using a
                                sudden burst of energy.<br><br>

                                However, the average male human can run up to speeds of 5.9 miles per hour (9.5
                                kilometers per hour). The average
                                running rate of women is a little less at 5 mph (8 kph).<br><br>

                                We know it is possible to run faster than this as we have seen world records been
                                broken.
                                <br><br>
                                However, it doesn’t only involve training; it also depends on many factors such as
                                height, weight, strength, injury, and
                                illness.<br><br>

                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The “runner’s high” is the euphoric and uplifting experience
                                some get when exercising. It won’t happen instantly as it
                                requires a large number of endorphins to be released.<br><br>

                                Most runners will experience this after around two hours of running.<br><br>

                                Essentially the prefrontal and limbic regions of the brain pump out endorphins when
                                exercising. When a sudden surge or
                                high volume is produced, we experience a euphoric high.<br><br></p>

                                <li>You use 200 muscles to take your first step into running. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>

                                There are two main muscle groups that we use when running, which help us to propel
                                forwards. These are the muscles in
                                the hamstrings and the calves.

                                <br><br>

                                However, we also use other muscle groups around our bodies for balance and
                                momentum.<br><br>

                                Depending on how muscle groups are categorized, humans use 200 muscles
                                simultaneously to take a single step.<br><br>

                                This means that when you are about to start running, 200 muscles are working
                                together to get you going, which might
                                explain why we burn so many calories from running.

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                Running is a natural ability that humans have developed over thousands of
                                years.<br><br>

                                Running once served our ancestors as a survival method, but now running is seen as a
                                great form of exercise.<br><br>

                                The “runner’s high” has become a natural phenomenon many strive to experience at
                                least once.<br><br>

                                Some humans have the capability to run more than others and some faster than others;
                                however, we are all capable to some
                                extent.<br><br>
