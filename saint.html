                        <p class="card-text fs-4">St. Patrick is arguably the most famous saint associated with
                            Ireland. His feast day is celebrated around the world and
                            is a common symbol of Irish patriotism.

                            His legends have become commonplace in our understanding of Ireland, and the image of
                            the bishop with a clover is an
                            immediately recognizable symbol for many.

                            But despite his popularity we know very little about the actual man. It would seem the
                            legend of St. Patrick has become
                            far more famous than the historical individual.

                            Without further ado, I present to you 16 facts about the real St. Patrick.<br><br></p>







                        <ol type="1" class="fs-4">

                            <li>His real name may not have been Patrick. We don’t know for certain what his birth
                                name was, but tradition holds it was
                                Maewyn Succat. He only later changed it to Patrick when he became a bishop, as it
                                means “nobleman” in Latin. <br><br></li>
                            <li> There are surviving copies of texts written by St. Patrick. Two Latin works called
                                “Confessions” and the “Letter to the
                                Soldiers of Coroticus.” These works provide the primary sources for what we know of
                                him.<br><br></li>
                            <li> Dating St. Patrick’s life is difficult, but most estimates place him around the mid
                                fifth century. Given that he refers
                                to the Frankish people (who lived in in places where Germany and France are now) as
                                pagans in one of his works, this
                                implies it was written between 451, with a large amount of Franks spilling into Gaul
                                (most of what is today Western
                                Europe), and 496, when the Franks were baptized in large numbers.
                                <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li> There is a prayer said to have been written by St. Patrick, entitled “St. Patrick’s
                                Breastplate,” but him being the
                                author is now widely rejected by scholars.<br><br></li>
                            <li>No one knows where St. Patrick was born. It’s a widely accepted fact that St.
                                Patrick is not an Irish native and is
                                probably from Wales, but his specific birthplace is unclear. In his own works he
                                says he’s from a place called Bannavem
                                Taburniae, but this location is otherwise unknown. <br><br></li>
                            <li>St. Patrick was not the first Christian Bishop in Ireland. That honor goes to the
                                fifth century bishop Palladius.
                                Palladius was a Roman Catholic Deacon who was sent by the Church to convert the
                                Irish natives. Some speculate this
                                person was adopted by folklore and combined with the later Patrick to form his
                                legend. <br><br></li>
                            <li> He didn’t drive snakes from Ireland. Everything we know about biology tells us that
                                Ireland was never a home to any
                                snakes. The story has been explained as being a metaphor for Patrick converting of
                                the remaining native Druids to
                                Christianity. But pagan practices continued long after St. Patrick lived, so the
                                exact meaning of the story is unknown.<br><br></li>
                            <li> Almost all the stories we have about St. Patrick were written centuries after he
                                died. Two commonly cited sources are
                                “The Life and Acts of St. Patrick” by a Jocelin of Furness, who wrote around 1200,
                                and “The Most Ancient Lives of Saint
                                Patrick” by an unknown MacEvin who wrote his works in the ninth century.<br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li>St. Patrick gives only the names of his father, Calpornius, and paternal
                                grandfather, Potitus. He says his father was a
                                deacon and his grandfather a priest. Though later writers further explained his
                                family tree. Jocelin and MacEvin say his
                                mother was a Frankish woman named Conceis. Conceis was said to be related to Saint
                                Martin of Tours. Though MacEvin
                                claims she was his sister and Jocelin says she was his niece. <br><br></li>
                            <li>St. Patrick never mentions having any siblings in his works, but Jocelin and MacEvin
                                claim he had a sister named Lupita. <br><br></li>
                            <li> From St. Patrick’s own works, we gather he was kidnapped from his home at about the
                                age of sixteen and brought to
                                Ireland alongside thousands of others to be sold as slaves. Patrick worked as a
                                shepherd for six years. Jocelin says he
                                was slave to a pagan prince named Milcho, though Patrick says nothing specific of
                                his captor. Saying only he was “the
                                man with whom I had been for six years”.<br><br></li>

                            <li>Jocelin and MacEvin ascribe many miracles to St. Patrick in his youth, and describe
                                him as pious from his early years.
                                Though Patrick himself seems to contradict these statements. In reference to his
                                capture in his youth, he says that “at
                                that time, I did not know the true God”. <br><br></li>
                            <li>St. Patrick is often said to have used the shamrock to explain to the Irish pagans
                                the concept of the Trinity. Despite
                                the fame of this story the shamrock or its significance to such a way is never
                                mentioned in any work by St. Patrick and
                                is apparently a much later legend attached to him. <br><br></li>
                            <li> St. Patrick, despite being known as the Patron Saint of Ireland, was never formally
                                canonized. His recognition as a
                                saint was done through popular opinion, and likely with the approval of a bishop.
                                Though he’s far from the only saint to
                                never have been formally canonized. In fact, the church had no formal process for
                                sainthood until the twelfth century.
                                So it’s safe to assume St. Patrick will always be considered a saint.<br><br></li>
                            <li> The date of the 17th of March was chosen for St. Patrick’s feast day on account of
                                it being the day he is said to have
                                died. The year was said to have been 461, but we do not know for certain.<br><br>
                            </li>

                            <li>The St. Patrick you know may in fact be based on several people. While we are quite
                                certain that St. Patrick was a
                                historical person, it’s possible that the folkloric character may be derived from
                                two different people. Patrick of Wales
                                and the previously mentioned bishop Palladius. The two bishops had stories about
                                them circulating until they became one
                                unified preacher. <br><br></li>
