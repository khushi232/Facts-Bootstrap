                            For thousands of years, this character has been written about across various religious

                            end up in hell?<br><br>

                            Here are 10 sinister facts about Satan that you should know.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The name Satan can be translated from many different languages
                                to mean different things, but they all link back to what
                                we think of when we hear the word Satan.
                                <br><br>
                                The word “Satan” in Hebrew is a generic noun that means “accuser” or
                                “adversary.”<br><br>

                                In the Hebrew Bible, this word is used for human and supernatural
                                adversaries.<br><br>

                                It is said to have derived from the verb that would have been used for
                                “obstruct.”<br><br>

                                This is how Satan’s name came to be the most commonly used word to describe the
                                opponent of God.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Satan first appeared in a poem called Paradise Lost.

                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The idea of a character representing evil first appeared in
                                the text Paradise Lost.
                                <br><br>
                                Up until this point, Satan had no set representation or form that had been
                                established.<br><br>

                                Written in 1677, John <br><br>Milton’s poem explains the fall of man and the fall of
                                an
                                angel.

                                Milton’s poem bases Satan on the idea of him being a foe of man and God with
                                Medieval ideas of what Satan represented.
                                <br><br>
                                This was one of the first texts to help clarify and define what Satan was.<br><br>

                                <li>Satan wasn’t always a character to be fearful of.

                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In the Middle Ages, Satan was seen as a laughing stock and a
                                character that was more of an annoyance to God.<br><br>

                                Satan would often be depicted in theatrical plays as the comedic fool, who was not
                                only clumsy but an ugly character
                                too.<br><br>

                                American historian Jeffrey Burton Russell described Satan as “more pathetic and
                                repulsive than terrifying” during the
                                Middle Ages.<br><br>

                                A collection of writings called “The Golden Legend” was compiled around 1260, and
                                they told tales of saint’s encounters
                                with Satan.<br><br>

                                They spoke of how the saints would use their intelligence to overcome him.<br><br>

                                It wasn’t until the 1430s that Satan became associated with witchcraft, and this is
                                when he started to become seen as a
                                fearful character.<br><br></p>

                                <li>Satan’s number is 666.

                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The number 666 is known as “the number of the beast” or that
                                of Satan or any demon.<br><br>

                                It was first written in chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation of the New
                                Testament.<br><br>

                                Number 666 is associated with being “man’s number” or “the number of a man.”<br><br>

                                In the Book of Revelation, 666 was the number given to Roman Emperor Nero, as it is
                                the numeric value of his name.
                                <br><br>
                                He was a nasty and vicious ruler; therefore, this is where the association of the
                                number 666 and evil has stemmed from.<br><br>

                                In mathematics, 666 is a triangular number and has many properties that make it
                                appear magical.<br><br>

                                Some people take the number association so seriously that they avoid all connections
                                with 666 as they fear it is the
                                devil’s work.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In 1409 John Wycliffe comprised a list of the seven fallen
                                angels who were all tempted by sin.<br><br>

                                Each of the princes fell from heaven for evil sins alongside Lucifer in the battle
                                against Michael.<br><br>

                                Lucifer fell because of Pride, and he is seen as the worst due to his status in
                                heaven.
                                <br><br>
                                Beelzebub fell due to envy; Satan was from wrath, Abadon from sloth, Mammon from
                                greed, Belphegor from gluttony, and
                                Asmodeus from lust.
                                <br><br>
                                Although each sin was labeled with an angel, all the sins form what we know as
                                Satan.<br><br>

                                Satan is sometimes used as the summary name for all seven sins.<br><br>

                                Wrath is seen as one of the most powerful sins hence why Satan has become one of the
                                most common names for evil.<br><br>

                                The most common form of servant associated with Satan is a demon.<br><br>

                                These are summoned by Satan and are usually in the form of an evil spirit.<br><br>

                                Satan obtains these spirits from the deceased who committed sins on earth, or
                                alternatively, they are other fallen
                                angels that sided with Lucifer.<br><br>

                                Demons are set to carry out all of Satan’s desires on earth, whether it be
                                terrorizing humans or tempting them into
                                sinful acts.

                                The word demon comes from the Greek word of “daimon,” which links to the words
                                spirit and guide.<br><br>

                                Essentially a demon is both of these; however, demons will guide you towards evil
                                rather than good.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Witchcraft, fairies, and magic have been believed in for
                                thousands of years, but it was until the 15th Century that some
                                aspects became associated with Satan.<br><br>

                                Until this point, the unknown and mystical elements of life were seen as normal
                                representations of both good and evil
                                acts.
                                <br><br>
                                In the 15th Century, the concept of organized satanic witchcraft started to become a
                                common take on magic.
                                <br><br>
                                Across Europe, from the 13th Century, Christian churches began to label witchcraft
                                as being an act of evil and that
                                witches were the servants of Satan.<br><br>

                                At the time, people were becoming more educated and sophisticated and therefore
                                could understand ancient religious texts
                                in more detail.<br><br>

                                This meant that texts about the devils work in summoning humans and tempting humans
                                become more real and applied to
                                daily situations.
                                <br><br>
                                The Christian church was against witchcraft, and therefore in order to banish and
                                prosecute witches, these links to
                                Satan gave them a valid reason.<br><br>

                                This was when Satan became seen as an active enemy rather than an adversary to
                                God.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In both Islam and Christianity, the devil is known most
                                commonly as a fallen angel and sometimes a genie.
                                <br><br>
                                The story in both these religions is that Lucifer went against God and was banished
                                from heaven.<br><br>

                                Some variations tell that he put himself forward to be the figure of the suffering
                                of humanity, and when Jesus was
                                chosen, Lucifer let his pride overcome him.<br><br>

                                Lucifer was a powerful angel with good looks and intelligence, and it was this that
                                gave him pride.<br><br>

                                His pride become overpowering and led to his exile and banishment from
                                heaven.<br><br>

                                Like other angels, he had a choice, and he let his sins overpower him and go against
                                God’s will.

                                Lucifer never lost his powers or intelligence and is known for leading the
                                opposition to God.
                                <br><br>
                                God never intended to create evil, and with Lucifer’s fall, he was always seen as
                                God’s adversary.<br><br>

                                of Hell and Satan than Darwin’s theory of evolution.<br><br>

                                The Harris poll surveyed 2,455 American citizens in 2005 with questions regarding
                                belief.<br><br>

                                The survey showed that 82% believed in God, 79% believed in miracles, and 62%
                                believed in Satan and hell.<br><br>

                                The audience that was skeptical of Darwin’s theory of evolution revealed that only
                                42% believed in his science.<br><br>

                                This indicates that there is more belief in Satan than in the theory of
                                evolution.<br><br>

                                Statistics have also shown an increase in the number of people believing in
                                Satan.<br><br>

                                A poll from 1990 showed that 55% of Americans believe in the devil and that there is
                                a hell.<br><br>

                                Gallup Poll showed that this rose to 70% of Americans in 2007.<br><br>

                                This is most likely due to the high numbers of religiously active people in the
                                USA.<br><br></p>

                                Some believe that he is a force like God but is the force of all evil.<br><br>

                                In the Bible, he is believed to have been the snake that tempted Adam and Eve, and
                                he has been known to take varying
                                representational forms.<br><br>

                                A mosaic found in the Basilica of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna, Italy, shows one
                                of the first Christian
                                representations of Satan.<br><br>

                                This piece of art from the 6th Century shows Jesus Christ with what is assumed to be
                                representations of good and evil by
                                his side.<br><br>

                                It was only in more recent years that he has become associated with his devilish
                                form.<br><br>

                                One of Satan’s first representations is from the Middle Ages, and he is represented
                                as a horned goat.<br><br>

                                His form represented elements that we associated with evil, horror, and decay.

                                However, this personification has developed and been shaped by our conceptions of
                                what we consider to be evil.
                                <br><br>
                                By the 18th and 19th centuries, his persona had become romanticized and more
                                human-like, perhaps resembling some of the
                                evil seen throughout the ages.
                                <br><br><br><br>


                                Satan is the adversary to God, and this keeps the world balanced with good and
                                evil.<br><br>

                                Without Satan, the world would have no evil and suffering, but Satan is a reminder
                                that evil still exists.<br><br>

                                Although Satan was first seen as an annoyance and harmless character, his persona
                                has developed through the ages to
                                become something we fear.<br><br>


                                Some people find contentment in Satan’s story and journey as they can relate to
                                similar suffering; however, it is not a
                                reason to implement suffering on others.<br><br>
