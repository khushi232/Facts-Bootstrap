                            most popular superheroes.

                            His famous blue suit and red cape have made him a recognizable icon that many look up
                            to.

                            But who first created Superman, and why is he so popular?

                            Here are 10 speedy facts about Superman that you probably didn’t know.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Many know that Superman has more than just one power, but do
                                you know the extent of his capabilities?

                                Superman has incredible strength, x-ray vision, heat vision, super speed, and the
                                ability to fly.

                                As well as these well-known traits, he also has super sharp hearing and the ability
                                to self-combust.

                                This more recent addition means that Superman can force himself to explode with the
                                equivalent force of a nuclear
                                detonation.

                                This is why Superman is sometimes referred to as “The Man of Steel” because he
                                appears invincible.<br><br> </p>

                                The first appearance was in DC Comics “Action Comics #1.”

                                Superman was designed and written by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, who came up with
                                the famous logo.<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">It is quite common throughout DC Comics for superheroes to
                                die, and most of the time, they find a way to come back.

                                Superman has had his fair share of visiting the afterlife, but he has one death in
                                particular which stood out.

                                The most iconic death was in the 1993 comic titled “The Death of Superman.”

                                In this story, Superman is beaten to death by Doomsday, and they both die fighting
                                each other.

                                Later on, Superman is brought back to life, which wasn’t the first time this
                                happened.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The first television series about Superman was “Adventures of
                                Superman,” which aired on September 19, 1952.

                                Filming began in 1951, and American actor George Reeves played Superman.

                                It was so popular that there ended up being six seasons with a total of 104
                                episodes. The final episode aired on April
                                28, 1958.<br><br> </p>

                                This lack of protection means that he is vulnerable to magical objects such as

                                interest, and Superman’s is Lois Lane.

                                Lois Lane works with Clark Kent at the Daily Planet as an award-winning journalist.

                                They dated for many years, and fans couldn’t wait to see them get married, which
                                they finally did!

                                The wedding coincides both on the television show Superman, as well as the comic
                                book in 1996.

                                It is shown in the release of Superman “The Wedding Album #1.”<br><br> </p>

                                The gravitational force on Krypton is a lot higher than on Earth, so this makes

                                A farmer and his wife raised Clark Kent in Kansas after they found him as a baby.

                                His earth family brought him up like other humans and gave him the courage to fight
                                against evil.

                                Kent then moved to the city of Metropolis, where he became a journalist for the
                                Daily Planet.<br><br> </p>
