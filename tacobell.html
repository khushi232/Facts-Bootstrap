                            meets the eye.<br><br>

                            From its exclusive Mountain Dew flavors to that undeniably addictive Doritos taco shell,
                            there’s a lot to learn from
                            this creative and innovative company.

                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Glen Bell, the founder of the Taco Bell chain, started out
                                serving burgers.
                                <br><br>
                                With very little money, he opened a burger stand called Bell’s Burgers (named after
                                his sister) and competed with the
                                McDonald’s brothers. Yes, those McDonalds.<br><br>

                                But by the 1950s, he knew he needed to get out of the burger business, so he
                                experimented with Americanized Mexican
                                food.<br><br>

                                Tacos were still not a popular food for most Americans at this time, and the idea of
                                fast food tacos was unheard of.
                                <br><br>
                                He aimed to bring them to the masses, which meant making them easier to eat.<br><br>

                                Essentially, he developed a crunchy fast food shell and adapted the tacos’
                                ingredients to suit the tastes of the
                                customers he was trying to reach – busy Americans looking for fast food.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li> He opened his first Mexican-inspired restaurant under a different name.<br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">His tacos became an instant hit and gradually outsold his
                                burgers. Eventually, Bell opened his first restaurant to serve
                                Mexican food.<br><br>

                                Taco Tia opened in San Bernardino, California, in 1954, selling tacos for 19 cents
                                each. Soon after, he opened another
                                similar restaurant in Los Angeles called El Taco.
                                <br><br>
                                He opened his first Taco Bell restaurant in Downey, California, on March 21,
                                1962.<br><br>

                                Taco Bell was franchised in 1964, and within three years, there were 100 locations.
                                The chain is now operating under the
                                Yum! Brands with 7,791 restaurants at the end of 2021.<br><br>
                            </p>


                            <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  mx-5 ">
                                <li>Doritos Locos Tacos went through 40 rounds of recipe testing to perfect the
                                    shell. <br><br>
                                </li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Although the idea seemed simple, the iconic DLT proved to be
                                much more challenging to execute than the creators had
                                anticipated.
                                <br><br>


                                For the chain’s 50th anniversary in 2012, CEO Greg Creed wanted to develop something
                                new and innovative.<br><br>

                                A Doritos taco shell was the clear winner out of 30 different product
                                pitches.<br><br>

                                The first version was an absolute flop with taste testers.<br><br>

                                Since it was a taco shell sprayed with nacho cheese seasoning, it lacked the crunch
                                or flavor of Doritos chips, which
                                was the main selling point.
                                <br><br>
                                The other prototypes were crunchy but too fragile to ship.<br><br>

                                It took time to find the balance of the crunch and flavor of Doritos with the
                                sturdiness of a taco shell.<br><br>

                                But after 40 recipes and two years of testing, the product launched with massive
                                success in 2012 and has remained on the
                                menu ever since.<br><br>

                                fans.<br><br>

                                It is a blend of Mountain Dew and lime flavor that works well with the

                                popular because of the Taco Bell chihuahua ads.<br><br>

                                With $500 million spent on advertising, the chihuahua became a cultural
                                phenomenon.<br><br>

                                Advertising for the character stopped in 2000, but disputes started as early as
                                1998.<br><br>

                                Two Michigan men, Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks, created a “psycho chihuahua”
                                character and had discussed adapting the
                                character for Taco Bell advertisers.<br><br></p>

                                chain was the first to hire female managers.<br><br>

                                He said that all the managers were men in the early days, but they didn’t have
                                enough of them.<br><br>

                                To fill demand, they hired women and became the first restaurant chain to do

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The company has had some interesting marketing gimmicks over
                                the years, but there’s none as infamous as their ad
                                announcing that they’d purchased the Liberty Bell.<br><br>

                                In 1996, a few weeks before April 1st, execs began planning their April Fool’s
                                joke.<br><br>

                                The VP of Public Affairs remembered that federal budget issues led to many national
                                landmarks closing during the
                                previous year.
                                <br><br>
                                That’s where he got the idea to “sponsor” the Liberty Bell.<br><br>

                                Taco Bell’s PR agency placed a full-page ad in six big papers, such as the New York
                                Times and Washington Post, and on
                                April 1st, the papers came out.<br><br>

                                The ad stated that they had purchased the national icon to help the national debt,
                                and it would now be called the “Taco
                                Liberty Bell.”<br><br>

                                Although they released a statement later that day saying it was a prank, customers
                                had lodged thousands of complaints to
                                the National Park Service against the company.<br><br>

                                Not only did the hoax increase sales from the previous week, but the company got
                                loads of free advertising as other news
                                outlets picked up the story.<br><br>

                                With all the creative culinary options and ad campaigns the chain has come up with
                                over the years, we’re looking forward
                                to seeing what they come up with next.

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                Taco Bell has been serving arguably one of the best Americanized-Mexican fast food
                                out there at the moment.<br><br>

                                We’re definitely excited to see what they add to their menu next!<br><br>
