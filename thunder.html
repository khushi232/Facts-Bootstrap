                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Both thunder and lightning are incredible acts of nature that
                            occur across the globe.<br><br>

                            The loud boom of thunder and the striking light produced by lightning can be seen now
                            and again in our skies when we
                            experience a storm.<br><br>

                            In this article, we will look at what thunder and lighting are and what their causes
                            are.<br><br></p>


                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What causes thunderstorms?
                        </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">A thunderstorm occurs when there is an unstable atmosphere and
                            where cold air meets hot air.<br><br>

                            The hot air rises, and as it reaches the colder air, it forms water droplets. This
                            process is called convection.<br><br>

                            Sometimes these water droplets can freeze while moving around.<br><br>

                            The updraft of hot air can be so quick that it forms cumulonimbus clouds.<br><br>

                            Cumulonimbus clouds, more commonly known as thunderstorm clouds, are the only types of
                            clouds that can cause hail,
                            thunder, and lighting.<br><br>

                            A thunderstorm is when a cumulonimbus cloud builds up too much energy.<br><br>

                            This happens when all the frozen water particles move around the cloud at high speed and
                            bump into each other. These
                            collisions create an electrical charge.<br><br>

                            Once the electrical charge has built up in the cloud, the positive protons form at the
                            top of the cloud, and the
                            negative protons gather at the bottom.<br><br>

                            The buildup becomes positively charged and needs to be released, causing a
                            thunderstorm.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What is lightning?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Lightning is the bright flash of light or electricity that is
                            caused by a thunderstorm.<br><br>

                            When protons have built up in the cloud, they attract oppositely charged protons around
                            them.<br><br>

                            This means that positively charged particles on the ground below will attract the
                            negatively charged particles on the
                            bottom of the cloud.<br><br>

                            The negatively charged particles from the cloud will be attracted to any positively
                            charged particles close by so in
                            things such as mountains, people, or trees.<br><br>

                            The charge coming from these ground points will eventually meet the negative particles
                            in the cloud, which causes
                            lightning to strike.<br><br>

                            This is the same as when you experience a static shock.<br><br>

                            Lightning is the electrical surge created between the cloud and earth, and lightning is
                            the result.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">What is thunder?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Thunder is the sound of the lightning bolt.<br><br>

                            The rumble that we call thunder is the sound of the vibrations created by the
                            lightning.<br><br>

                            When the charge happens, it vibrates particles as it moves.<br><br>

                            Because lightning is such a large discharge of energy, the vibrations it causes are
                            massive.<br><br>

                            Lightning bolts are also very hot, and this immediate heat causes air particles to
                            expand, which creates more force.<br><br>

                            These vibrations travel as sound waves to our ears, and we hear a rumble as a
                            result.<br><br>

                            If you are close enough to a lightning strike, you might hear a crack or whip
                            noise.<br><br>

                            We hear a more crisp sound when closer because the sound waves of the lighting
                            vibrations have not become distorted by
                            bouncing off surrounding objects.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Why don’t we hear thunder at the same time as seeing lightning?
                        </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The main reason for not hearing thunder at the same time as seeing
                            lightning is that sound waves travel slower than
                            light.<br><br>

                            Light waves travel at a faster speed, so we will see the flash before we hear the
                            rumble.<br><br>

                            There is a myth that if you count the time between seeing the flash and hearing the
                            rumble, you can tell how far away
                            the storm is.<br><br>

                            However, this has been proven not to be an accurate way of measuring the distance
                            between yourself and the storm.
                            <br><br>
                            This technique can be used to estimate distance but with a little more math than just
                            counting.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Where do the most amount of thunder and lightning storms occur?
                        </h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">The places that experience the most thunderstorms on earth lie on
                            the equator.<br><br>

                            This is due to the climate along the equator as it is hot and humid.<br><br>

                            For this reason, it is very uncommon to experience a thunderstorm at both the North and
                            South Poles.<br><br>

                            The equator is known as being the most static place on earth, and it produces some of
                            the most spectacular lightning
                            shows.<br><br>

                            The Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa was known as the thunderstorm
                            capital.
                            <br><br>
                            The mountain village of Kifuka in DR Congo experiences an average of 158 lightning
                            flashes per 247 acres (square
                            kilometer) each year.<br><br>

                            Other locations to experience high levels of thunderstorms are Venezuela and
                            India.<br><br>

                            NASA research showed that in east India, the Brahmaputra Valley experienced the highest
                            amount of lighting per month
                            between April and May, which is during their annual monsoon.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4 class=" fs-1 fw-bold  ">Where is the thunder capital of the world?</h4><br><br>
                        <p class="card-text fs-4">Although many places along with the equator experience high
                            volumes of thunder and lightning, there is one place like no
                            other.<br><br>

                            Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela has an average of 250 lightning flashes per 247 acres
                            (square kilometer) each year.<br><br>

                            The natural phenomenon is known as Catatumbo lightning or the Beacon of
                            Maracaibo.<br><br>

                            The point is where Lake Maracaibo meets the Catatumbo River, and there are around 260
                            storm days every year.<br><br>

                            Lake Maracaibo holds the Guinness World Record for having the highest concentration of
                            lightning.
                            <br><br>
                            In October, it is possible to see up to 28 lightning flashes each minute at Lake
                            Maracaibo.<br><br>



                            Thunder and lightning are natural wonders that occur mostly in humid climates; however,
                            they can be experienced almost
                            everywhere in the world.<br><br>

                            Lightning is the static shock from a buildup of tension in the atmosphere, and thunder
                            is the booming sound made when
                            the lightning crashes.<br><br>
