                                alone.

                                This made it the most the app has ever achieved to date in one month.<br><br>

                                The growth in downloads was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as many people
                                spent time indoors with their
                                smartphones.

                            <p class="card-text fs-4"> The original app of TikTok was launched in 2016 and created
                                by Bytedance in China.<br><br>

                                They called the app “Douyin” and then launched it to the western market in 2017 as
                                TikTok.
                                <br><br>
                                Douyin is exactly the same app as TikTok however, in China, it attracts a slightly
                                older demographic, with users ranging
                                from children to middle-aged adults.<br><br>

                                <li>Around 41% of TikTok users are between the ages of 16-24.

                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">TikTok was designed with a younger demographic in mind.
                                <br><br>
                                The app allows users to express themselves through lip-syncing, acting, dancing, and
                                singing.<br><br>

                                In 2019 a survey showed that 41% of users were between 16-24 years old, and it is no
                                surprise given the point of the
                                app.<br><br>

                                It attracts a younger audience because of the nature of content creation; it is a
                                form of self-expression. <br><br>

                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Musical.ly was launched in 2014; with users uploading short
                                videos of themselves lip-syncing and being comedic.<br><br>

                                However, this changed to TikTok when the two merged in 2017.<br><br>

                                On November 9, 2017, Chinese company Bytedance, TikTok’s founder purchased
                                Musical.ly for $1 billion USD.<br><br>

                                TikTok hoped to take over the market and attract younger users.<br><br>

                                The merge happened on August 2, 2018, bringing TikTok users and Musical.ly accounts
                                together to form one community.
                                <br><br>
                                TikTok is a globally available app, except for in China where it has remained a

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">In 2019 as part of TikTok’s “You’re in Control” content
                                series, campaigners were designed to help users.<br><br>

                                In an attempt to prompt users, TikTok created advertisements to remind users to take
                                a break from the app.
                                <br><br>
                                The campaign worked alongside TikTok celebrities to encourage users to drink water
                                or get food, as sometimes you can get
                                so lost on the app you forget to take care of yourself. <br><br>

                                That’s more than the total number of downloads in the US, with 200 million downloads

                                However, on June 29, 2020, The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

                                TikTok, there was an earlier attempt in reducing screen time.<br><br>

                                This campaign was introduced in April 2019 and encouraged users to take breaks from
                                continuously looking at the screen.
                                <br><br>
                                The screen time management feature encouraged “digital wellbeing” by allowing users
                                to put time limits on their daily
                                usage.<br><br>

                                This was a response to research into the effects of the app on the mental wellbeing
                                and brain development of the users.
                                <br><br>
                                Some studies have shown that watching short videos on a loop can reduce attention
                                span, especially on a developing
                                brain. <br><br>

                                average total time spent by a user on TikTok was 52 minutes per

                                Users will on average open the app eight times per day and spend around 6-7 minutes
                                on the app.<br><br>

                                That is almost one hour of time spent either uploading and creating video content or
                                scrolling through the abundance of
                                content already on the app.<br><br>

                                Compared with other social media apps, this is a normal average, as Instagram users
                                spend around 53 minutes per day on
                                the app. <br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">TikTok more than doubled its annual revenue in 2019. By the
                                end of 2018, it was worth $7.4 billion and reached $17
                                billion by the end of 2019.<br><br>

                                TikTok became the world’s most valuable privately-owned company in early

                                However, as of 2021, it reached an incredible worth of around $75 billion

                                As well as being a profitable app, the average TikTok star can earn anything between
                                $50,000 to $150,000 per year.

                                TikTok has become one of the world’s most popular and regularly used apps and social
                                media platforms.<br><br>

                                Its creators have targeted the younger generations and created a slightly addictive
                                platform.<br><br>

                                However, this platform is a place where teens can express themselves creatively with
                                a global audience from the comfort
                                of their home. <br><br>
