                            the most important food groups, with dietitians worldwide stressing the point that we
                            really need to make them the
                            largest part of our diet.<br><br>

                            Not only are they incredibly cheap when compared to meat and processed foods, but
                            they’re super low-carb too!<br><br>

                            They’re fantastic for our health, being full of a wide range of vitamins minerals, as

                            For many people, though, there’s always the question of what vegetables to eat. If you

                            vegetable aisle, it can be pretty overwhelming!<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Coming from the cruciferous family of vegetables, broccoli can
                                be found in cuisines from all over the world.<br><br>

                                The part of the vegetable that is most commonly eaten is the flower of the plant,
                                referred to as the head.

                                nutritious!<br><br>

                                A single cup (3.2oz/91g) of raw broccoli is absolutely bursting with nutrients,
                                containing:

                                10% of daily required fiber, folate, manganese, and vitamin A<br><br>


                                It’s also claimed that eating broccoli can help reduce the risk of cancer and lower

                                A single cup (1.1oz/30g) of chopped raw spinach is more than just a tasty addition

                                Spinach is also rich in a wide variety of antioxidants, which help reduce the risk

                                Two of these antioxidants are lutein and beta-carotene, which also have ties to

                                Asparagus has been enjoyed for such a long time that there’s a recipe for cooking it

                                cookbooks!<br><br>

                                It’s generally enjoyed in spring, when the young shoots of asparagus are cut before
                                they grow too large and wood-like in
                                texture.

                                A single cup (4.7oz/134g) of raw asparagus has a balanced variety of nutrients,
                                containing:

                                <br><br>

                                20% of daily required vitamin A

                                16% of daily required iron
                                13% of daily required vitamin C, thiamine, and copper
                                A wide variety of other minerals and nutrients in good levels such as fiber, vitamin

                                manganese.
                                Asparagus can be enjoyed in many ways, from soups to salads, to much more. One of
                                the best ways is to keep it simple.

                                Sprinkle asparagus with some salt, olive oil, and a little parmesan, and roast it in
                                the oven for a delicious yet

                                Not only is asparagus delicious yet nutritious, it’s also one of just a few sources

                                play a vital role in maintaining a well-balanced diet!

                                It comes from the allium family, so it’s related to other shoot-like vegetables such
                                as onions, leeks, shallots, and
                                chives.

                                It’s been used in kitchens for thousands of years and as a medicine for even longer.

                                Its medicinal benefits have long been taken advantage of, with records of its use
                                going back to the ancient Egyptians!<br><br>

                                A single cup (4.8oz/136g) of raw garlic, should you ever eat this much in one day,
                                contains:


                                <br><br>
                                114% of daily required manganese
                                84% of daily required vitamin B6
                                71% of daily required vitamin C
                                28% of daily required selenium
                                Strong amounts of a healthy variety of minerals and vitamins such as calcium,
                                phosphorous, copper, potassium, thiamine,
                                and riboflavin.
                                The benefits of garlic don’t just stop with the nutrients as mentioned above – it’s
                                also a natural antibiotic!<br><br>

                                Garlic has also been attributed to helping reduce the risk of cancer, lowering
                                cholesterol and blood pressure, and even
                                reducing the risk of having a stroke.<br><br>

                                The most effective way to gain nutrients from garlic is to eat it raw, as the longer
                                it is cooked, the more it loses
                                nutrients.<br><br>

                                This versatile root vegetable has been around for some time now, originating in
                                Europe and Southwestern Asia.<br><br>

                                A single cup (4.5oz/128g) of raw chopped carrots may not give you night vision, but
                                it does contain:<br><br>

                                428% of daily required vitamin A.
                                21% of daily required vitamin K.
                                14% of daily required fiber.
                                A good range of vitamins and minerals in small doses such as vitamin C, vitamin B6,
                                folate, potassium, and manganese.<br><br>
                                <br><br>

                                The vitamin A you receive from carrots comes from beta-carotene, which your body
                                then converts into vitamin A if your
                                body requires it.

                                Beta-carotene is also what gives carrots their vibrant orange color.<br><br>

                                Be careful not to eat too many carrots, though, or your skin will turn
                                orange!<br><br>

                                A single teaspoon (0.7oz/2g) of raw ginger is such a small quantity that its levels

                                They’re available year-round and are always one of the cheapest vegetables you can
