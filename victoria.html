                            The Victorian era was during the reign of UK’s Queen Victoria, from her coronation in
                            1837 through to her death in 1901.<br><br>

                            While many wonderful things happened during the Victorian era, such as the Industrial
                            Revolution and great social
                            reforms, people also did some straight-up bizarre stuff.<br><br>

                                who had an affection for all things cute and cuddly,

                                bodies.<br><br>

                                No, really. Walter created elaborate tableaus of scenes from various nursery rhymes
                                using the bodies of animals he came
                                across.<br><br>

                                His most famous work, The Kittens’ Wedding, is enough to make you wonder how sane he
                                really was.<br><br></p>

                                One mask, in particular, was made from rubber and looked like the creation of

                                Lecter himself.<br><br>

                                All one had to do was apply various dubious salves to the inside, strap on the “face
                                glove,” and then sweat profusely in
                                it all night.<br><br></p>

                                possible, which couldn’t be further from Victorian trends.<br><br>

                                Women in the Victorian era would nibble on chalk wafers laced with arsenic to keep
                                themselves looking as fresh out of
                                the coffin as possible.<br><br>

                                While highly toxic and addictive, it did at least turn the consumer’s skin a lovely
                                shade of white.<br><br></p>

                                Victorian families dressed their deceased in their Sunday best and propped them up

                                The justification was that they wanted to remember their loved ones looking their
                                absolute best, but seriously, no,

                                corpses, and the fresher, the better.<br><br>

                                Known as body snatchers, grave robbers would wait until families would leave the

                                set in.<br><br>

                                Apparently, tucking a feather into their hat wasn’t enough for the Victorian
                                fashionista.<br><br>

                                The demand was so excessive that a conservationist estimated as many as 67 species

                                <li>Some wealthy Victorians kept people in their gardens as living garden gnomes.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Garden gnomes are already pretty weird, especially when people
                                have extensive collections of them.<br><br>

                                If you lived during Victorian times and were affluent enough (and a little bit
                                insane),
                                you would keep an old man as a
                                sort of pet.<br><br>

                                These hermits were often forbidden from grooming themselves and would live in the
                                nooks
                                and crannies of wealthy
                                Victorians’ gardens.<br><br>

                                In most cases, they weren’t even allowed to speak!<br><br></p>

                                <li>Victorians sent each other some of the most outlandish Christmas cards.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Christmas cards were invented during the Victorian era, and
                                while
                                some are pretty similar to those we see today, the
                                rest were weird and creepy.<br><br>

                                Why send a jolly-looking Santa Claus card when you could send your loved ones a card
                                with anthropomorphized insects or
                                frogs on it?<br><br>

                                We’re not going to lie; we might be sending a few copies of these to our friends and
                                relatives this year!<br><br></p>

                                <li>There were countless clubs dedicated to eating the weirdest animals alive.
                                    <br><br>
                                </li>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Even Charles Darwin, the man behind our theory of evolution,
                                was a
                                keen eater of anything exotic.<br><br>

                                Some clubs specialized, such as the Ichthyophagous Club, dined on the strangest sea
                                creatures they could find.<br><br>

                                Others, like the Glutton Club (of which Darwin was a member), seemed not to care
                                what
                                they were eating as long as it was
                                a new experience!

                                <br><br><br><br>

                                We can say for sure that some people in the Victorian era seemed to have too much
                                time
                                and money on their hands!<br><br>

                                It’s truly challenging to even wrap your head around some of these bizarre habits
                                and
                                hobbies, let alone imagine that
                                they were socially acceptable.<br><br>

                                Let’s just hope that hipsters don’t try and bring some of these trends back!<br><br>
