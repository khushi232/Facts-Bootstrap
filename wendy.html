                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Founder Dave Thomas named the fast-food chain after his fourth
                                daughter Melinda.
                                <br><br>
                                Although her name was Melinda, she had trouble pronouncing her name as a child,
                                particularly with pronouncing L’s and
                                R’s.<br><br>

                                So she often referred to herself as “Wenda,” and eventually, her nickname became
                                “Wendy.”
                                <br><br>
                                The logo for Wendy’s was also based on her looks, with red braided hair and
                                freckles.<br><br>

                                There were even photos of her hung in the first Wendy’s restaurant.

                                The first Wendy’s was opened on November 15, 1969, in Columbus, Ohio, US.<br><br>

                                Back then, the restaurant was called Wendy’s old-fashioned Hamburgers, but people
                                referred to it as Wendy’s for short.<br><br>

                                In August 1972, Wendy’s opened its first franchise, signing an agreement for a
                                Wendy’s restaurant to open in
                                Indianapolis, Indiana.<br><br>

                                Since then, the brand has continued to grow, but sadly the first Wendy’s that Thomas
                                opened in Ohio closed its doors in
                                2007.
                                <br><br>
                                As time goes on, there is a demand for different things, and sadly this location did
                                not have a drive-through and had a
                                lack of parking.<br><br>

                                As well as its square patties, Wendy’s is known for its chocolate Frosty.<br><br>

                                Around 300 million chocolate Frostys are served up ice cold every year.<br><br>

                                The Frosty is so popular that Wendy’s has tried to introduce new flavors over the
                                past 50 years.
                                <br><br>
                                Wendy’s has offered Frostys in strawberry and vanilla flavor as well as serving it
                                in a waffle cone.
                                <br><br>
                                Although they have been making them for over 50 years, Wendy’s didn’t trademark the
                                name “Frosty” until 2013. <br><br>

                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Nearly 10 years before Burger King introduced its value menu,
                                Wendy’s was already on the trend.<br><br>

                                In 1989 Wendy’s introduced a whole menu where items were priced at 99 cents.<br><br>

                                Unlike other chains that offered their flagship burger for just 99 cents, Wendy’s
                                decided to take over the market and
                                offer a range of products for 99 cents.<br><br>

                                This marketing trick attracted customers as there was more selection at a reduced
                                cost, and more often than not,
                                customers would purchase more than one item from the value menu.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                                <li>Wendy’s was not the first hamburger joint to sell square patties. <br><br></li>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="card-text fs-4">
                                Dave Thomas was inspired to open Wendy’s after his favorite burger joint called
                                Kewpee Hamburgers in his hometown of
                                Kalamazoo, Michigan.<br><br>

                                Kewpee Hamburgers were one of the first hamburger restaurants to serve square-shaped
                                patties.<br><br>

                                Thomas enjoyed the square patties because they gave the sense of having more meat as
                                the corners would poke out from the
                                burger bun.<br><br>

                                This made customers think they were getting more meat in their burgers and allowed
                                customers to see the quality of the
                                meat easier.<br><br>

                                This was one of the first things added to the menu, and it became an iconic burger
                                associated with Wendy’s.<br><br>

                                In 1992 Thomas set up the Dave Thomas Foundation, which helped adopted
                                children.<br><br>

                                Thomas was adopted as a child and never knew his biological family; however, his
                                adopted family gave him love and
                                supported him.<br><br>

                                He wanted to raise awareness by creating a non-profit charity that could offer
                                donations to adoption centers, so he set
                                up a signature program called Wendy’s Wonderful Kids.<br><br>

                                Previous to this, in 1990, President George Bush asked Thomas if he would be the
                                spokesperson for the White House
                                Initiative on adoption. <br><br>

                                Wendy’s introduced their salad bar in 1979, and it was the first fast-food
                                restaurant to do this.<br><br>

                                The Superbar was set up to host the salad bar and had different areas with themed
                                foods such as the “Garden Spot” and
                                “Pasta Pasta.”<br><br>

                                These were areas where customers could help themselves to unlimited salad sides for
                                $2.99.<br><br>

                                Sadly this was discontinued in 1988 as it was difficult to maintain and keep
                                clean.<br><br>

                                In 2019 Wendy’s released a board game titled Feast of Legends.<br><br>

                                The original name was Feast of Legends: Rise from the Deep Freeze, but when
                                released, it was shortened.

                                The game is a tabletop game played similarly to Dungeons and Dragons, with Wendy as
                                the Queen and main character of the
                                game.<br><br>

                                In Tokyo, Japan, a foie-gras burger was added to the menu in 2011.<br><br>

                                This was part of a re-design of menus due to a fall in sales, so the focus went on
                                developing a menu to suit local
                                flavors.<br><br>

                                The burgers sold for $16, and as well as this local adaption, you could also get an
                                avocado wasabi hamburger. <br><br>

                                By 1976 Wendy’s had opened 500 franchises across the US and Canada.<br><br>

                                They began to expand to Europe in 1979, starting in Germany.<br><br>

                                Wendy’s entered the Asian market when it opened its first franchise in Japan in
                                1980, then Hong Kong in 1982, and South
                                Korea in 1984.<br><br>

                                It wasn’t until the late 1980s and early 1990s that Wendy’s expanded globally into
                                Mexico, Turkey, New Zealand, and
                                Indonesia.<br><br>

                                As of 2020, they have a total of 6,500 restaurants.

                                Wendy’s has been around for 52 years, and it is still regarded as a popular
                                fast-food hamburger chain.<br><br>

                                It has expanded business on a global scale and created menus to cater to local
                                flavors.
