                                bear.<br><br>

                                Writer A.A. Milne gave his son a stuffed teddy bear for his first birthday that he
                                had bought in Harrods Department
                                Store in London.
                                <br><br>
                                The bear was originally named Edward, but it was changed to Winnie after Milne took
                                his son Christopher Robin Milne to
                                London Zoo.
                                <br><br>
                                The famous black bear called Winnie lived at London zoo at the time and was the
                                inspiration for the name change of
                                Christopher Robin’s teddy bear.<br><br>

                                The bear was called Winnie as it came from Winnipeg in Canada, after being donated
                                by a Canadian soldier who was drafted
                                for service in Europe during World War I.<br><br>

                                Christopher Robin would regularly visit the bear and sometimes he was allowed to
                                feed it.<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">You might be wondering where ‘The Pooh” part of the name comes
                                from, as the Winnie part makes sense.<br><br>

                                Pooh was a name given to a swan that Christopher Robin and his father saw on their
                                vacation in West Sussex, England.<br><br>

                                The swan is described in the book When We Were Very Young and it was a much-loved
                                creature that became an important part
                                of their lives.<br><br>

                                Christopher Robin would feed the swan every morning that they were away and this
                                inspired A.A Milne to create the name
                                Winnie-The-Pooh.<br><br>

                                It is said that Christopher Robin called the swan Pooh, because if the swan decided
                                to not respond to its name, then it
                                would look like Christopher was just saying “oh Pooh!” to show that he was not
                                bothered that the swan ignored him.<br><br>

                                A.A. Milne then fused the two names Winnie and The Pooh to form Winnie-The-Pooh and
                                he explains in the first
                                Winnie-The-Pooh book that the bear’s functions aren’t always in great shape which
                                means he is a bit pooh.<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The first-ever illustration of the character was drawn by
                                Ernest Howard Shephard in 1924.<br><br>

                                The illustration was featured in a book of poetry called When We Were Very Young,
                                written by A.A. Milne and illustrated
                                by E.H Shephard.<br><br>

                                It wasn’t until 1925 when the bear was published alongside the name
                                Winnie-The-Pooh.<br><br>

                                This illustration appeared in a Christmas story that was published in the London
                                Evening News on Christmas Eve.<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The first collection of stories to feature Winnie The Pooh was
                                written by A.A Milne in 1926. The book was titled
                                Winnie-The-Pooh.<br><br>

                                In 1928, this was followed by his next series titled The House at Pooh
                                Corner.<br><br>

                                35,000 copies were sold upon its release in the UK and an amazing 150,000 copies in
                                the US.<br><br> </p>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">Winnie The Pooh is known to wear his iconic red t-shirt, but
                                he wasn’t always so well dressed.<br><br>

                                The red t-shirt was added when the rights to the character were bought by
                                Disney.<br><br>

                                The original sketches and drawings of the character were just of a bear that didn’t
                                wear any clothes and as drawings
                                developed he was pictured with a t-shirt on.<br><br>

                                In 1930 Stephen Slesinger acquired all rights of Winnie The Pooh, for use in the US
                                and Canada from A.A Milne.<br><br>

                                In 1932 the first color drawing by Slesinger was seen by the public and this is
                                where Pooh’s iconic red t-shirt came

                                to Disney for the use of Winnie The Pooh, but in 1961
                                Disney changed the character which would become the success it is today.<br><br>


                                Disney changed the name from the previously hyphenated Winnie-The-Pooh to Winnie the
                                Pooh.<br><br>

                                With the help of their licensing agent Stephen Slesinger, they adapted the original
                                stories of Pooh to create features
                                that lead to a miniseries.<br><br>

                                These features were what made Pooh so famous in the Disney universe.<br><br>

                            <p class="card-text fs-4">The much-loved stories became popular across the globe so
                                translations were much needed.<br><br>

                                The high demand meant that around 50 translations of the books were made, some of
                                the languages include French, Spanish,
                                Italian, Latin, Russian, Thai, Hindi and Catalan.<br><br>

                                It was at the time a popular book on-demand, especially across European
                                countries.<br><br>

                                Italy was the country least interested in the translation of the books after being
                                first translated into Italian in
                                1936.<br><br>

                                It is thought that due to the government at the time, the book might not have been
                                of interest to promote to the public
                                and no copies of the first Italian translation have ever been found since.<br><br>

                                the setting of Pooh’s home is a real place.<br><br>

                                Hundred Acre Wood is where the character of Winnie The Pooh and his friends live and

                                So to celebrate their joint 90th birthday a special story was created where Pooh
                                bear goes to visit the Queen to
                                celebrate.<br><br>

                                The story was written by Jane Riordan and was illustrated in a similar way to the
                                original drawings, pre-Disney.<br><br>

                                The story tells a tale of Pooh and friends visiting the Queen at Buckingham Palace
                                so they can both celebrate their
                                birthdays together and to deliver a special gift to the Queen.<br><br>

                                celebrity.<br><br>


                                Winnie The Pooh has a day all to himself, January 18 is National Winnie The Pooh Day
                                and is celebrated in England.<br><br>

                                This date was chosen as it was A.A. Milne’s birthday and as the creator of such a
                                loved character, it was decided that
                                in his honor, his birthday should be the chosen date.<br><br>

                                Winnie The Pooh Day has been celebrated from as early as 1986, where people would
                                read his stories, eat lots of honey
                                and get cozy watching one of his films.<br><br>

                                In more recent years the hashtag #WinnieThePoohDay is widely used across social
                                media to celebrate the day.<br><br><br><br>



                                The classic story of Winnie The Pooh is a timeless creation that will inspire
                                generations to come.<br><br>

                                The beloved bear has made his mark in history and is an iconic figure from many
                                people’s childhood.<br><br>

                                The honey eating bear will continue to live on through Disney’s adaptations of the
                                original storybook by A.A Milne.<br><br>
